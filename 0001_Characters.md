# Capítulo 1: Personagens

Um personagem é definido por uma série de elementos diferentes que descrevem suas capacidades. Estes elementos são:

- Características: como Força ou Carisma;
- Atributos: coisas como Altura e Movimento;
- Perícias: especializações em habilidades fundamentais.

A maioria destes elementos são descritos na forma de números e, alguns são dependentes ou calculadas a partir de outros. O que cada elemento significa e como eles são determinados, estão descritos nas seções a seguir.

## Passo 1: Conceito do Personagem

A good place to start is to have some idea of what sort of character you want to play; a hardened fighter for example, or a cunning rogue. Your character concept does not need to be elaborate at this stage; simply an idea that will help guide certain choices such as Race and Class. A few character ideas are listed to provoke your imagination.

- Young, naïve magic-user
- Bad-tempered half-orc fighter
- Overconfident halfling rogue
- Pious dwarf cleric

---
## Passo 2: Características

Everyone is defined by seven Characteristics which tell you something about your character; how strong or fast they are; how clever or healthy. Characteristics are at the core of every _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ character and form the basis for most of the other elements such as Attributes and Skills. The seven Characteristics are:

- Strength (STR)
- Constitution (CON)
- Size (SIZ)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Power (POW)
- Charisma (CHA)

Before calculating the Characteristics, the following section explains what each represents.

#### Força (FOR)

STR represents physical strength: how much one can lift, how hard one can hit, and so on. STR is a component of the [Damage Modifier](0001_Characters.md?id=damage-modifier) (see the [Attributes](0001_Characters.md?id=step-3-attributes) section below). If a character is reduced to zero STR they lack the ability to move or lift objects.

#### Constituição (CON)

CON is a measure of health and hardiness. CON is a component in determining [Hit Points](0001_Characters.md?id=hit-points) and [Healing Rate](0001_Characters.md?id=healing-rate) (see below). If CON falls to zero for any reason the character dies.

#### Tamanho (TAM)

SIZ measures mass and helps indicate Height and Weight. SIZ is used to help figure [Hit Points](0001_Characters.md?id=hit-points), as larger, heavier creatures tend to have greater endurance against damage. SIZ can also be used to determine a character's Damage Modifier, since mass helps to increase the force of a blow.

#### Destreza (DES)

Agility, balance, and reflexes are measured by DEX. It is an important aspect of [Initiative](0001_Characters.md?id=initiative). If a character is reduced to zero DEX, they suffer functional paralysis.

#### Inteligência (INT)

INT is a measurement of cognitive ability. Those with a lower INT score are not necessarily stupid, but they are likely to be constrained in how creatively they can employ their wits. INT is a factor in calculating [Initiative](0001_Characters.md?id=initiative). If INT is reduced to zero, the character becomes completely mindless.

#### Poder (POD)

POW is a measurement of a character's soul, spirit, inner drive, or capacity for magic. POW governs a character's [Magic Points](0001_Characters.md?id=magic-points) and [Luck Points](0001_Characters.md?id=luck-points). If a character's POW ever drops to zero, they lose all independent will.

#### Carisma (CAR)

Charisma measures personality and is independent of physical appearance. CHA affects a character's [Experience Modifier](0001_Characters.md?id=experience-modifier). If CHA ever falls to zero, the character can no longer socially interact with others, becoming so painfully shy or antisocial they are ignored or even driven away.

---
### Calculando Características

Each Characteristic has a numerical value to determine how potent it is. The number in parentheses after each dice score is the racial average and is used as a gauge to rate your character's results when compared to other members of their species. Suggestions for determining your Characteristics include:

- **Dice Roll:** Roll the dice indicated in the Racial Characteristics Table for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA taking each rolled score as it comes. Since the results of these rolls can be somewhat random, it is often better to decide on a character concept after the dice are rolled. Otherwise, the final Characteristics may preclude a preconceived role. Roll 3d6 for STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA; then 2d6+6 for SIZ and INT.
- **Dice Roll, Assign:** As above, except the player may exchange values between Characteristics with the same dice range. For example, when rolling up a human, the player could swap values among STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA, as they share a 3d6 range, or between SIZ and INT, which share the 2d6+6 range —but they must always be from the same dice range group; you cannot switch rolls from one group to the other.
- **Dice Roll, High:** Roll one extra die as indicated for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA, and drop the lowest result from each.
- **Points Build:** Instead of rolling dice to determine Characteristics, players build their character from a preset pool of points, the amount of which is determined by the character's species. This method is best for groups that know what they want to play and want to tailor their build to a specific Class. Certain rules apply to the Points Build option:
  - Begin with the racial average for each of the seven Characteristics as noted in parentheses after each dice range below.
  - Spend another 10 points (humans) or 6 points (demi-humans) to increase Characteristics.
  - You may also lower a Characteristic to gain extra points. For example, reduce STR 11 to 9 to gain 2 points.
  - Characteristics cannot be _lower_ than the minimum possible or _greater_ than maximum possible for that Characteristic as determined by its potential dice roll.

Games Masters are free to come up with their own methods or point values as desired.

The following table summarizes the information needed for each of the above methods. The dice ranges are used in either of the Dice Roll methods, while numbers in parentheses are used in Points Build.

##### Tabela de Características Raciais

| Race | Dwarf | Elf | Gnome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| STR | 2d6+9 (16) | 2d6+4 (11) | 2d6+1 (8) |
| CON | 2d6+9 (16) | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+6 (13) |

| CHA | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+1 (8) | 2d6+5 (12) | 3d6 (11) |

---
## Passo 3: Atributos

Each character also has a set of attributes. These are capabilities derived from the Characteristics or determined by them that are used to govern certain factors of game play.

#### Pontos de Ação

How often a character can act in a [Combat Round](0008_Combat.md?id=combat-rounds) is determined by Action Points. Starting characters begin with 2 Action Points but gain more as they rise in Rank. See the relevant Class Advancement Tables under [Classes](0003_Classes.md) for details.

#### Modificador de Dano

The bonus amount of damage a character inflicts when they physically strike or apply force. It is generally used in combat situations but can also be utilized when attempting to break objects. The Damage Modifier is an extra die roll which is either added to, or subtracted from, the damage inflicted by the weapon or tool. If a negative Damage Modifier takes a weapon's damage to zero or below, then no damage at all has been inflicted.

Add together STR and SIZ and consult the Damage Modifier table:

##### Tabela de Modificador de Dano

| STR+SIZ | Damage Modifier |
| :-: | :-: |
| 5 or less | –1d8 |
| 6–10 | –1d6 |
| 11–15 | –1d4 |
| 16–20 | –1d2 |
| 21–25 | +0 |
| 26–30 | +1d2 |
| 31–35 | +1d4 |
| 36–40 | +1d6 |
| 41–45 | +1d8 |
| 46–50 | +1d10 |
| 51–60 | +1d12 |
| 61–70 | +2d6 |
| 71–80 | +1d8+1d6 |
| 81–90 | +2d8 |
| 91–100 | +1d10+1d8 |
| 101–110 | +2d10 |
| 111–120 | +2d10+1d2 |
| 121–130 | +2d10+1d4 |
| Each 10 points | Continue Progression |

#### Modificador de Experiência

Over the course of play characters improve their skills and capabilities. This is achieved using Experience Rolls which are explained in more detail in the [Game System](0007_Game_System.md?id=experience-rolls) section.

A character's CHA score may adjust the number of Experience Rolls the character has, reflecting the relationship they have with their peers and their reputation in the community. If CHA is high people are willing to put themselves out to help train or support the character while they undergo tuition. Conversely, if CHA is particularly low, there may be some difficulty improving one's capabilities without the assistance of others; finding someone to spar against for example.

##### Tabela de Modificador de Experiência

| CHA | Exp. Modifier |
| :-: | :-: |
| 6 or less | -1 |
| 7-12 | +0 |
| 13-18 | +1 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

#### Taxa de Cura

After receiving injuries, a character needs to recuperate. Healing Rate determines how quickly they naturally recover from wounds. Depending on the severity of the injury (see the section on [Damage and Wounds](0007_Game_System.md?id=damage-and-wound-levels)), the Healing Rate denotes how many Hit Points are recovered per day, week, or month.

##### Tabela de Taxa de Cura

| CON | Healing Rate |
| :-: | :-: |
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

#### Iniciativa

The moment at which someone reacts in combat is governed by Initiative. Initiative acts as a modifier to Initiative rolls; the higher the Initiative, the faster one responds in a combat situation, determining when you can act. Further factors – armor for example – modify it. The [Combat](0008_Combat.md?) chapter goes into more detail on how [Initiative](0008_Combat.md?id=initiative) is used.

Initiative is the average of the DEX and INT Characteristics.

#### Pontos de Sorte

Luck Points represent that strange force differentiating adventuring heroes from everyday folk. Call it fate, karma, or simple good fortune. Luck Points can be used to:

- Re-roll the dice if they are unfavorable.
- Mitigate physical damage or other unfortunate circumstances.
- Gain an edge at a vital moment in combat.

Exactly how they are used, and when, is described in the section, [Using Luck Points](0007_Game_System.md?id=using-luck-points). Once a Luck Point is spent, the pool decreases; when one is out of Luck Points, no more are available – unless the Games Master makes an impromptu award – until the next game session when they replenish to their normal value.

##### Tabela de Pontos de Sorte

| POW | Luck Points |
| :-: | :-: |
| 6 or less | 1 |
| 7-12 | 2 |
| 13-18 | 3 |
| Each 6 points | +1 |

_\* Humans start with one additional Luck Point over and above that shown above._

_\*\* All characters gain an additional Luck Point as each new Rank is attained._

#### Pontos de Magia

Mystical abilities and spells cast in _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ usually rely on Magic Points. Since the availability of magic may be limited by a campaign setting or to specific magical professions, some characters will find this Attribute superfluous.

For those who can utilize such powers, a character's Magic Points are equal to their POW. These points are used to cast spells, the cost of which is dependent on the type of magic used. When casters run out of Magic Points they have exhausted their ability to cast any spells until Magic Points are replenished.

#### Taxa de Movimento

Every creature has a Movement Rate – several feet that can be traveled during a specific period. Movement is not calculated from Characteristics but is a default value which differs from species to species. The Base Movement Rate for humans is 20 feet, although certain skills can improve this. The section on [Movement](0008_Combat.md?id=movement) offers more detail.

##### Tabela de Taxa de Movimento por Raça

| Species | Feet | Metres |
| :-- | :-: | :-: |
| Dwarf | 15 | 4.5 |
| Elf | 20 | 6 |
| Gnome | 15 | 4.5 |
| Half-Elf | 20 | 6 |
| Half-Orc | 20 | 6 |
| Halfling | 15 | 4.5 |
| Human | 20 | 6 |

#### Pontos de Vida

Hit Points represent how much injury an area of the body can withstand before it becomes useless, possibly resulting in incapacitation and ultimately the character's death. The body of every creature is divided into separate locations – humans, for example, have seven; the head, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs – each location with its own Hit Points.

Some creatures, such as monsters or different classes of animal, by their very nature often have radically different body structures, yet each location they possess still has Hit Points. When a location's Hit Points are reduced to a certain level through damage of any kind, then the character suffers certain consequences that reflect the severity of the injury. For further information concerning wounds see the section on [Damage and Wounds](0007_Game_System.md?id=damage-and-wound-levels).

To calculate the Hit Points of each location, add CON and SIZ together and cross-reference the result on the Hit Points table. All characters gain 1 additional Hit Point in each location at Rank 2 and 4.

##### Tabela de Pontos de Vida por Local

| Location | CON+SIZ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  | 1–5 | 6–10 | 11–15 | 16–20 | 21–25 | 26–30 | 31–35 | 36–40 | +5 |
| Head | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |
| Chest | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | +1 |
| Abdomen | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| Each Arm | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| Each Leg | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |

## Passo 4: Perícias

By default, every character has a range of Standard Skills allowing him to perform a variety of actions with varying degrees of expertise. These skills are detailed more fully in the [Skills](0005_Skills.md) chapter but cover a range of everyday activities and local knowledge which anyone can use without specialized training. At this point of character creation, players will only need to know the Base Levels of each Standard Skill.

The basic score of each Standard Skill is determined by the sum of two Characteristics or a multiple of a single Characteristic. The value represents the character's innate competence in each area, in effect their raw talent before any formative training received as part of his culture and profession.

The Standard Skills Table shows how the basic values are calculated, along with a brief description of what the skill is and does. The score represents the percentage chance of success for a skill; so, an Athletics score of 25 is expressed as 25%. How skill percentages work and more detailed skill descriptions are provided in the [Skills](0005_Skills.md) chapter.

Note that the basic percentages for some skills will be modified by both culture and profession, so these starting values will change as character creation progresses.

##### Tabela de Perícias Comuns

| Skill | Basic Percentage |
| :-- | :-: |
| Athletics | STR+DEX |
| Boating | STR+CON |
| Brawn | STR+SIZ |
| Conceal | DEX+POW |
| Customs | INT x2, +40\* |
| Dance | DEX+CHA |
| Deceit | INT+CHA |
| Drive | DEX+POW |
| Endurance | CON x2 |
| Evade | DEX x2 |
| First Aid | INT+DEX |
| Influence | CHA x2 |
| Insight | INT+POW |
| Locale | INT x2 |
| Native Tongue | INT+CHA, +40\* |
| Perception | INT+POW |
| Ride | DEX+POW |
| Sing | CHA+POW |
| Stealth | DEX+INT |
| Swim | STR+CON |
| Unarmed | STR+DEX |
| Willpower | POW x2 |

_\* Includes a static bonus of +40% for both Customs and the character's Native Tongue (Common for humans). Each demi-human race may speak the Common Tongue at +40%, in addition to their Native Tongue at +40%, as detailed in their respective write-ups._

---
## Passo 5: Raça/Cultura

In _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, players may typically choose from one of six races for their characters: Human, or one of the demi-human races (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, or Halfling). If human, they must further define their character through one of three cultural backgrounds; Barbarian, Civilized, and Nomadic. For humans. culture determines the kind of society in which the character was raised, and so prescribes certain outlooks and philosophies they might have. More practically, culture helps define the values of the various skills that shape your character's overall capabilities. The demi-human races generally come from a racial culture which is much more stereotypical of the race in general. See [Chapter 2](0002_Culture_and_Races.md)'s race and culture write-ups for more information.

All characters have an Alignment, which consists of one Ethical and one Moral Code, as well as two or three Passions. Some will have an Oath to a religious order, guild, or organization. Each Class write-up notes any required Alignment or Oaths. Before continuing, look up your race in [Chapter 2](0002_Culture_and_Races.md) and note the suggested Alignment and Passions, and check the [Classes](0003_Classes.md) section and see if there are any Alignment or Oath requirements. See [Chapter 4, Alignment & Passions](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md) to determine any specifics regarding your Alignment, Passions, and Oaths, if any.

Each race and culture lists a variety of Standard Skills that the character learns as part of his formative development within that society. These are core abilities which all characters from the same specific culture improve to some degree. Characters also learn a few specialized or esoteric Professional Skills according to their personal interests.

Professional Skills are further explained in the [Skills](0005_Skills.md) chapter, but in brief they represent those skills which cannot be attempted without years of rigorous study and specialized training. Whereas a character has a basic ability in all Standard Skills, they have zero ability in any Professional Skill unless chosen as part of their cultural upbringing or Class.

Chosen Professional Skills start off at their Base Level Characteristic value as per Standard Skills. Some Professional Skills such as Craft, Languages, or Lores offer choice of a specialization. In these cases, the specialty chosen should be one which suits that culture.

### Racial Skill Quick Picks

Quick Picks provide an average selection of skills, enabling quick character creation. Feel free to swap points, if desired; however, no skill can have fewer than a +5 or more than a +15 bonus.

##### Racial Quick Picks Table

| Race/Culture | Standard Skills | Professional Skills |

_\* Humans are not limited in the selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice._

_\*\* During character creation, additional languages are limited to gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll._


### Racial Skill Point Buy

Optionally, you may spend points to customize a specific character concept. This allows for a more tailored character at the expense of time. When applying Skills perform the following steps:

- Select three Professional Skills from the options offered (See [Chapter 2](0002_Culture_and_Races.md) for race descriptions).
- Distribute 100 points among the listed Standard Skills and chosen Professional Skills, increasing that skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Players are free to choose how much each skill is improved by, but each skill must receive a minimum of 5% and cannot receive more than 15%.

---
## Step 6: Class

Class represents the career the character has embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood, and it further defines the character's skill development.

Players are normally free to choose which Class they wish their character to play assuming that the Games Master deems it suitable. The Class write-ups give some guidance as to the common Classes available to each racial/cultural type. This should be seen as common representations, and not restrictions. Players should feel free to play as any Class/Race combination that best fits their vision.

Like Race/Cultural backgrounds, each Class offers the chance to improve a range of Standard and Professional Skills commonly used by that occupation. Unlike cultural backgrounds, characters need not invest their points in every available skill but may tailor which ones are taken as those fitting for their specific role or Culture.

### Class Skill Quick Picks

Choose a Class Quick Pick for an average selection of skills useful to the Class in question. Feel free to swap points, if desired; however, while the skill can be reduced to a +0, functioning at Base Level (including Professional Skills), no skill can have more than a +15 bonus. These skills already include any Class Skill Bonuses from Abilities.

##### Class Quick Picks Table

| Class | Standard Skills | Professional Skills |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Cleric | Combat Skill (Cleric) +15; First Aid +5; Influence +5; Insight +10; Willpower +15 | Channel +15; Courtesy +10; Devotion (deity) +15; Lore (Religion) +5 and one of the following at +5: Language (any), Lore (any), or Oratory |
| Fighter | Athletics +10; Boating or Ride +5; Brawn +15; Combat Skill (Fighter) +20\*\*; Endurance +15; Evade +10; Unarmed +15\*\* | Intimidation +10; and two of the following at +5: Gambling, Survival or Navigation |
| Magic-User | Evade +10; First Aid +5; Influence +5; Insight +5; Locale +5; Perception +5; Willpower +15 | Arcane Casting +15; Arcane Knowledge +15; Language (any) +5; Language (any) or Lore (any) +5; Lore (Alchemy) +10 |
| Rogue | Athletics +15; Combat Skill (Rogue) +10; Deceit +5; Evade +15; Insight +5; Perception +5; Stealth +15 | Language (Thieves' Cant) +40\*\*\*; Lockpicking +10; Mechanisms +10; and two of the following at +5: Acrobatics, Acting, Commerce, Disguise, Intimidation, Seduction, Slight, or Streetwise |

_\* Acquired at the Base Level._

_\*\* Includes a +5 Combat Proficiency bonus._

_\*\*\* Acquired at the Base Level, +40% bonus applied._

### Class Skill Point Buy

Optionally, you may spend points to customize a specific character concept. As above, this allows for a more tailored character at the expense of time. Characters using this method, develop their Class skills in the following way:

- Select up to 3 skills from the Professional Skills available to that Class.
- Distribute 100 points among the Class's listed Standard Skills and whatever Professional Skills were chosen, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Not all the available skills need to be improved, but no individual skill can receive more than a 15% increase. Some Classes grant more than 3 Professional Skills, but never more points.
- All Classes include a Combat Skill that encompasses the weapons that Class is typically trained in the use of. This may be as few as 4 or 5 simple weapons as in the case of the magic-user, to all weapons and shields as in the case of the fighter. Where Combat Skill is included in the list of Standard Skills, it is treated as such and may be improved with Class Skill Points. Where Combat Skill is omitted, as is the case of the magic-user, it may only be improved using Bonus Skill Points during Step 7 of character creation.

Newly chosen Professional Skills and the Class Combat Skill start at their Base Level Characteristic value. Choosing a Professional Skill previously gained via cultural background simply allows the character to further apply some of their Class Skill Points at this stage. Some of these skills, such as Craft, Language, or Lore, offer the choice of a specialization. In these cases, the specialty selected should be one that suits the character's culture.

Certain Classes may have either more skills to choose from or may choose more skills than others. This is balanced by the fact that all characters are still built with the same 100 points. So, a character with more skills will end up having to spread their points more thinly knowing a little about a lot, and a character that has fewer skills to choose from will end up being more specialized.

#### A Note on Class Abilities and Rank

Keep in mind that all Classes require a skill level of at least _**40% in any five Class skills**_ to utilize that Class's special Abilities or to cast spells. You are considered competent in a skill at 50% or higher. So, to qualify for Rank 1, the character must possess any five Class skills at 40% or higher. Rank 2 requires any five Class skills at 70%, Rank 3 requires any four Class skills at 90%, and so on.

A character may choose to start at Rank 0 if they do not have sufficient skill levels and attain Rank 1 in play if they desire, but to be able to use or cast spells, these prerequisites must be met.

#### Combat Skill (STR+DEX)

Combat Skill is the skill relating to fighting and the use of weapons. It is a diverse skill with many specializations related to the pertaining character Class. Most fighting traditions encompass training in multiple weapons of the same type, along with the techniques required to use them all effectively. Therefore, Combat Skill is an umbrella that melds together many related aspects of fighting under a single ability, removing the need to purchase multiple sub-skills.

Combat Skill has a Basic Percentage equal to STR+DEX.

Since most people can pick up a weapon and instinctively either swing, throw, or fire it, Combat Skill is considered a Standard Skill. Yet due to their potentially diverse nature, they are categorized and defined separately.

All characters learn their Combat Skill as part of their chosen Class, as described in [Chapter 3](0003_Classes.md).

## Step 7: Bonus Skill Points

At this stage, every character gains an additional pool of 'free' Skill Points based on Experience Level, which can be distributed among existing skills. These are provided to round out the character, adding interests or areas of expertise. The default for fresh beginning characters is a pool of 100 points, with a limit of assigning no more than 10 points per skill. If characters are more experienced, then the number of Skill Points and restrictions will differ, as indicated on the Experience Table.

Bonus Skill Points are used in the following ways:

- Allow the character the option of choosing one final new Professional Skill for free, reflecting a personal hobby or interest.
- Alternately, the character may add a new weapon type to their Combat Skill.
- Either add a +10 bonus to ten different skills, or distribute points among them, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. No individual skill can receive more points than indicated by their Experience Level. If you choose a new Professional Skill, you must add points to it.
- Save for the optional hobby specialty, no points may be assigned to Professional Skills not learned as part of their culture or Class.

### Creating Experienced Characters

It is recommended that beginning characters start fresh, at Rank 1, with little or no practical experience. Of course, the level of the characters will depend greatly on the setting and whether the game will be a short one-off adventure or a long-running campaign. It is also common for a player to create a more experienced character if replacing one that has died in play or when joining an existing campaign.

A table is provided, breaking experience into Experience Categories. A character's Experience has a direct correlation to age and skill competence; more experienced characters naturally have more life experience than their younger compatriots. However, the noted Age Bonus should be treated as approximate, as campaigns advance at different rates — some campaigns have lots of game time pass between adventures while others are one long string of unbroken adventures. When converting an existing character, simply substitute the actual age for that noted below.

This table may also be used for NPCs, whether built using a Class or a career, and follows the same rules. There is one exception: Non-Player Characters built as part of a career have no special Abilities, including the extra Luck Points, which are reserved for player characters and significant Non-Player Characters only. Note that a starting NPC built as a career is Rank 1 by default.

##### Experience Table

| Rank (Level\*) | Age | Bonus Skill Points | Maximum Skill Increase | Average Skill Level\*\* | Advancement |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Rank 1 (1-4): _Fresh_ | By species | 100 | +10 | 40-60 | Any 5 Class Skills at 40% |
| Rank 2 (5-9): _Low Level_ | +1d6 | 300 | +30 | 65-75 | Any 5 Class Skills at 70% |
| Rank 3 (10-14): _Mid-Level_ | +1d6+5 | 500 | +50 | 85-95 | Any 4 Class Skills at 90% |
| Rank 4 (15-19): _High Level_ | +1d6+10 | 700 | +70 | 105-115 | Any 3 Class Skills at 110% |
| Rank 5 (20+): _Epic Level_ | +1d6+20 | 900 | +90 | 125-135 | Any 2 Class Skills at 130% |

_\* The number in parentheses may be used as a gauge when converting existing characters from Level-Based games._

_\*\* This is the average skill level of any skills of particular importance to the Class in question._

**Experience Table Notes**

- Rank is a rough descriptive guide to compare characters of differing skill levels.
- Age is determined by calculating age according to species and adding any noted bonus. It is more of a guideline than a hard and fast rule, as time passes differently from campaign to campaign.
- Bonus Skill Points determine how many points the character must spend on developing skills. This is NOT cumulative with those of previous ranks. For example, a Rank 2 character is built with 300 points, not 300 points, plus the 100 from Rank 1.
- Maximum Skill Increase limits how many of the Bonus Points can be applied to any one Skill.
- Average Skill Level shows the typical range for a character's most important Class-related skills at each Experience Level. It is included for reference purposes and assumes Base Level Characteristics of 16, with maximum Skill Points spent during each step. Actual results will vary.
- Advancement: This represents the number of Class Skills required to attain the noted Rank. For example, to attain Rank 3, any four of the Class Skills noted in the relevant Class write-up must be at least 90%.

## Step 8: Finally…

- Determine your Alignment and Passions based on your chosen Culture/Race and Class. See [Chapter 4](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md).
- Note any Starting Abilities from your Race and Class.
- Under Ranked Abilities, choose one Rank 1 Class Ability that you meet the requirements for at no cost in EXP rolls.
- Copy down starting equipment as noted at the end of your Class write-up.
- Do not forget to give your character a name. Also, look for ways to establish connections with other characters if desired.
