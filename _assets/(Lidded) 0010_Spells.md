## Spell Descriptions

---
#### Appraise

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Turn |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Item | **Resist:** None |

Appraise allows the immediate assessment of the quality of physical goods of combined ENC in 'Things' or SIZ equal to the caster's POW. The spell determines whether identical looking items are of the same or similar quality, or if one or more is either flawed or of a higher quality. The spell does not work on organic things, only on inanimate objects. Neither does it determine what flaws or enhancements are present; merely that they exist. It is of no use in the identification or detection of magic.

---
#### Armor

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** None |

When this spell is cast, the subject is gifted with an invisible field of magical force equal to scale armor in protection, granting 4 Armor Points to each Hit Location. It has no effect if cast on someone already wearing armor. It will however supersede natural armor for its Duration, assuming it offers superior protection. If cast on a creature possessing more than 4 points of natural armor, it will instead increase the Armor Points by 1 in all locations. This magical protection does not hinder movement or spell casting. The spell will persist until dispelled by magic, or the caster sustains 8 points of damage from a single attack, +1 per level of additional Intensity (see the table below). Of course, the caster may choose to drop the spell at any time if desired and must do so to sleep.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 8 damage from 1 attack |
| 2 | 4 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 9 damage from 1 attack |
| 3 | 5 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 10 damage from 1 attack |
| 4 | 6 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 11 damage from 1 attack |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

---
#### Astral Spell

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5, Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Astral | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster and up to five others (one per additional level of Intensity) to enter the Astral Plane. All must be touching and forming a circle while the spell is cast. The travelers' bodies are left behind in the plane of origin, and they typically do not bring with them any clothing or equipment, except for that which itself radiates a magical aura; these items transform into astral equivalents of their normal form. The Duration lasts until the caster wishes it to cease. However, it is possible for it to be ended prematurely by an outside force such as Dispel Magic. Killing the caster's physical body also ends the spell early, although this has the unfortunate side effect of stranding any travelers accompanying the caster.

---
#### Augury

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft; |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster to determine whether a specific action to be taken within the next 30 minutes will be beneficial or detrimental to an individual and/or party's wellbeing. A focal point of some type is required to discern the omens, the most common being the claws or smaller bones of a dragon, a pearl, or pure gold valued at no less than 100GP in value, which has been crushed or melted down. The spell has a Maximum Intensity of 4. This roll should be made by the Games Master, as the caster should never know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether the results were interpreted correctly.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Formidable Channel skill roll |
| 2 | 6 | Hard Channel skill roll |
| 3 | 9 | Standard Channel skill roll |
| 4 | 12 | Easy Channel skill roll |

If the divination roll succeeds, it grants one of the following results:

| Augury | Implication | 
| :-: | :-- |
| Yes | The action will be beneficial |
| No | The action will be harmful |
| Yes and No | The action will be both beneficial and harmful |
| Nothing | The action will be neither beneficial nor harmful |

A Fumble should result in the Games Master telling the opposite of the reality.

---
#### Avert

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 0, Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** Instant |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 60 ft; |
| **Area:** 1 Spell | **Resist:** None |

Avert is used to dismiss another Rank 0 spell within Range. Avert can be cast reactively to neutralize offensive Rank 0 spells, by using the Counter Magic Reactive Action.

---
#### Befuddle

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 0, Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Turn |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** 30 Minutes |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 60 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

Befuddle causes confusion within the mind of a corporeal target. The subject of the spell has difficulty thinking straight, forgetting where it is, what it is doing, and why – often lapsing into disassociated lines of thought. Befuddled targets can still act in self-defense but cannot initiate any constructive activity until the spell ends. Any sort of attack or threatening action instantly breaks the spell, whether or not it was directed specifically at the befuddled target.

---
#### Blade Barrier

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Guardian, Creation | **Duration:** 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft |
| **Area:** 5-30 ft. radius | **Resist:** See Below |

This spell creates a barrier of whirling slicing swords, daggers, and knives that whip and slash around a fixed point and cause 1d8 points of damage to 1d4+2 random Hit Locations of _any_ passing through the Area of Effect. Armor only offers half its normal protection. Magic Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Because the weapons whirl around at blinding speed and are tightly packed, it is impossible to Parry or Evade them. One can use a shield to passively block Hit Locations normally. In this case, remember to compare the rolled damage to the armor and Hit Points of the shield.

The spell may be cast defensively to protect the cleric or one or more allies or offensively trap enemies. However, encircled enemies within five feet of the edge of the barrier as it is forming may make an Evade roll to escape. Regardless of success, the opponent ends up prone, just outside the Area of Effect. A successful roll results in no damage; otherwise, they suffer the full effect.

---
#### Bless \(R\)

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** All | **Duration:** 5 Minutes |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 180 ft. |
| **Area:** 25 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the cleric blesses a group of allies within the Area of Effect. Those affected radiate the Alignment of the caster, either Good or Evil. There are no blessings of Neutrality. All allies within the spell's radius receive a +5% bonus to all skill and Resistance rolls. In addition, their weapons cause +1d3 damage to intelligent undead as well as creatures from the outer planes that have opposing alignments to that of the caster, such as demons, devils, or angels. Note that while animated undead such as skeletons and zombies are not inherently evil, they are typically animated by evil magic and thus subject to this damage.

The reverse of this spell, Curse, allows the cleric to curse enemies, making the noted skills suffer the inverse of the benefits noted above. A cursed weapon's damage is calculated as a penalty instead, and this damage cannot result in less than 1 point.

---
#### Burning Hands

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 120-degree Cone, 5 ft. long | **Resist:** Evade |

This spell causes flames to shoot out from the caster's hands in a 120-degree arc. If using miniatures in combat, Burning Hands will damage each target that occupies 1 of the caster's front squares. Casting Burning Hands at higher levels of Intensity requires a higher Rank mage. This damage engulfs all targets within the area with damage based on the spell's Intensity, to a Maximum Intensity of 9, as follows. A successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case will only reduce damage by half unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Min Rank** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 | 1d3+1 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 3 | 4 | 1 | 1d3+2 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 5 | 5 | 1 | 1d3+3 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 7 | 6 | 2 | 1d3+4 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 9 | 7 | 3 | 1d3+5 points of damage to all Hit Locations |

Worn armor does not protect, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. This powerful spell is balanced by its noticeably short range, meaning, to cast it, the magic-user must be close enough to be in a very disadvantageous position.

Because larger creatures are typically bigger than the spell's Area of Effect, they will tend to have fewer Hit Locations affected. Those of SIZ 21 to 30 take the damage to their head, chest, abdomen, and arms, while those of SIZ 31+ will take the damage to their abdomen and legs. Games Masters should adjust these locations dependent on the target's shape and position relative to the caster. Burning Hands has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information.

---
#### Calm

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

Calm attempts to dampen down the Passions of a SIZ 1-20 humanoid target, perhaps ensuring that a lovesick paramour does not press his suit, a frightened rival does not scream for help, or that weapons are not drawn in anger. A calmed person is not otherwise mentally affected; thus, any sort of assault or threatening action still permits the target to defend themselves, and even attack, albeit they will do so in a calm and level-headed manner.

---
#### Chain Lightning

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Evade |

Upon casting, the mage releases a five-foot-wide bolt of electricity from their fingertips that can strike one target within range for 1d6+1 points of damage per 2 Intensity. The bolt then arcs to the next nearest object or creature, which takes the damage previously rolled minus 1 point, and then arcs to the next nearest, inflicting the damage rolled minus 2 points, and so on. It could even arc back to an ally or the caster! While the initial target must be visible to the caster, targets hit by an arcing bolt do not have to be.

Each arc has its own 50-foot range, which may place the bolt beyond the original range when the spell was cast. Chain Lightning continues to strike if it has damage remaining until it strikes an object that causes it to ground (a metal cage or bars, large pool of water, and so on) or there are no more objects or creatures available to strike.

Each creature struck takes the damage to a single Hit Location, with worn armor offering no protection, and natural armor and magical Armor Points reducing damage as normal.

With a successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, the victim suffers no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case only reduces damage by half.

Lightning has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x1%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information. Lightning may also shatter or destroy inanimate objects from sheer impact.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 50-ft range; 1d6+1 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 100-ft range; 1d6+1 damage |
| 3 | 5 | 150-ft range; 2d6+2 damage |
| 4 | 6 | 200-ft range; 2d6+2 damage |
| 5 | 7 | 250-ft range; 3d6+3 damage |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

---
#### Change Appearance

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2d6 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell alters the appearance of the caster to that of any humanoid or person-shaped bipedal form. Height and Weight change is limited to ±5 SIZ, respectively, but within that range, a caster may choose to become fat or thin, tall, or short, or even alter gender. Hair, clothing, and equipment may be changed along with appearance. The caster's facial features may be changed as desired, even to the extent of perfectly imitating another existing person. The spell is subject to [disbelief](0009_Magic.md?id=attempting-to-disbelieve) as per other Illusion spells. The spell does not alter the caster's scent, and if touched, the caster still feels the same as their original shape and clothing.

---
#### Chant

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Combat | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 30 ft. Radius | **Resist:** N/A |

All those within the Area of Effect receive a +5% bonus to all skill rolls and a +1 bonus to damage, both per level of Intensity. Enemies within the same area suffer the inverse of the benefits noted above.

The Chant must be maintained throughout the spell's Duration or the effects end. The casting of Dispel Magic has no effect on the ongoing effects of Chant as the chanting itself is not magical; however, the casting of Silence nullifies the spell's benefits. The effects of Chant stack with those of both Bless and Curse. Because of the requirement to chant throughout the Duration, casting other spells is impossible.

---
#### Charm Person

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 360 ft |
| **Area:** 1 living human, demi-human, or humanoid | **Resist:** Willpower |

When this spell is cast, one living (undead creatures are unaffected) sapient humanoid target of SIZ 1-20 will cease all hostilities against the magic-user and the magic-user's allies, and instead offer to help and protect them if the target fails a Resistance roll. Note that helping/protecting can have an unintended or even negative effect for the caster, as the subject acts based on what it feels is the best course of action to protect/help. With regards to commands, a target will never obey suicidal or obviously harmful actions but might be convinced that something extremely dangerous is worth doing.

Any hostile act against the subject of the charm by the magic-user or allies breaks the Enchantment. Note: If others challenge the nature of the Charm, the target may also make a Resistance roll, per the Games Master's discretion. The magic-user must be able to speak with the charmed one to give it any sort of complex 'request'; therefore, knowing the target's language can be important, but not required for the basic Enchantment.

After the initial roll to resist, 1 week must pass before the subject can make another Resistance roll. The effects are ongoing until a successful Resistance roll is made. Casting Charm Person at higher levels of Intensity requires a higher Rank mage and has a maximum Duration of 4 weeks. Throughout the Duration of the spell, the caster's Magic Point total is reduced by the number spent to cast the spell, as per the [Enduring Magic Costs](0009_Magic.md?id=enduring-magic-costs) rules.

#### Charm, Mass

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Rounds |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 40 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** Willpower |

With the exceptions noted above, this spell functions like the spells [Charm Person](0010_Spells.md?id=charm-person) and Charm Monster. This most powerful of Charm spells has a chance to enthrall all creatures within the Area of Effect of any SIZ. Human-sized and smaller (SIZ 1-20) find their rolls to resist Hard; Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) must make their Resistance rolls at Standard Difficulty, and the resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Easy.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Charmed for 1 week |
| 2 | 6 | Charmed for 2 weeks |

| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 180 ft |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

This is an improved version of the spell [Charm Person](0010_Spells.md?id=charm-person) in that it will enthrall all living creatures of SIZ 20 or less within the Area of Effect, or 1 creature of any SIZ. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are more difficult to charm, with their resistance roll being Easy, and the resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. The spell functions in all other ways as per Charm Person.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Min Rank** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | Charmed for 1 week |

#### Chill \(R\)

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** None |

Chill dramatically reduces the temperature of a small object with an ENC no greater than 1 'Thing' in size, down to the temperature of ice water. Useful for rapidly cooling hot items, chilling drinks, and so forth. The spell does not freeze an object, and neither does it cause any damage to its structure: it merely renders it very cold.

When reversed, Heat, dramatically increases the temperature of small objects up to the temperature of boiling water. This versatile spell is useful for mulling wine, cooking food without a fire, or warming a bed prior to sleep. It does not affect living tissue although it can affect clothing and armor, making it somewhat uncomfortable, but not to the extent of hindering the wearer.

#### Cleanse \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Willpower |

Cleanse is used to rid an object, person or small area of dirt, grease, grime, bad smells, and so on. It does not organize or tidy the target or area; merely cleans them to a spick-and-span state. This spell is often used to launder clothes. The caster can clean up an area equal to POWx5 in square feet (a 5-foot square is 25 square feet).

Dishevel is the reverse of Cleanse. Objects affected are immediately covered in grime, dust, cobwebs, and so forth. The spell can be used to make brand new objects look old and weathered or help prevent normally well-turned-out people from being recognized.

#### Command

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** 1 Minute |
| **Cost:** 3 | **Range:** 100 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the cleric may utter a single-word command to one living creature of SIZ 1-20, and on the subject's next Turn, the command will be followed to the letter if they fail to resist. This essentially causes the victim to miss the next Turn completing the action commanded and wastes an Action Point while performing it. If the victim possesses no more Action Points, the commanded action will be performed during their first Turn of the next Round. The command itself cannot cause any actual injury to the target; however, injury may come as a secondary effect of the command.

For example, a command to die would result in the victim collapsing in a death-like state for 1 Round causing no actual injury; however, a command to fall given to a creature climbing a 100-foot-high cliff face could be more than deadly.

The subject of the command must be able to understand the language spoken by the caster and is allowed a Willpower test to resist.

**Some Example Commands**

- **Crawl:** The subject drops prone and begins to crawl.
- **Die:** The subject falls prone entering a comatose death-like state.
- **Fall:** The subject falls prone.
- **Fumble:** The subject fumbles a physical action about to be taken.
- **Sleep:** The subject nods off.
- **Flee:** The subject turns and flees the caster.
- **Fly:** The subject flaps their arms and runs in circles.
- **Go:** The subject starts walking in the direction it was facing.
- **Halt:** The subject stops immediately and stands in place.
- **Leave:** The subject turns and leaves by the way it entered.
- **Rest:** The subject drops to a sitting position and catches its breath.
- **Run:** The subject begins to run.
- **Scream:** The subject yells.
- **Sink:** The subject stops swimming.
- **Surrender:** The subject drops its weapons and ceases hostilities.

#### Cone of Cold

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Evade |

The caster creates a cone of blistering cold extending from their hand. The Area of Effect is a 90-degree arc (a "cone") extending 10 feet in length per level of Intensity. The spell causes 1d6+1 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. Roll the damage once and apply it to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering only half protection, but a creature's natural armor or magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. The Games Master may choose the number of locations affected by whatever means they deem appropriate if a huge creature is larger than the Area of Effect.

With a successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, the victim suffers no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case only reduces damage by half, unless they are within five feet of the edge of the Area of Effect. Cone of Cold has a chance of coating a victim with a layer of ice equal to the rolled damage (after modification) x5%. If frozen, once per Round, the victim may spend an Action Point and make a Brawn roll to attempt to break free; however, until successful, the unfortunate victim cannot move or perform any other actions.

**Cone of Cold Effects**

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 10 ft long; 1d6+1 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 20 ft long; 1d6+1 damage |
| 3 | 5 | 30 ft long; 2d6+2 damage |
| 4 | 6 | 40 ft long; 2d6+2 damage |
| 5 | 7 | 50 ft long; 3d6+3 damage |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Confusion

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 4, Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 120 ft. (Cleric version 250 ft) |
| **Area:** 30 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower (Cleric version is Hard Willpower) |

When this spell is cast, 1d4 creatures of SIZ 1-20 within the area of effect that fail their Resistance roll will be struck with a magical confusion. Each additional level of Intensity will affect another 1d4 creatures to a maximum of 4d4. The cleric version affects 1d3+1 per Intensity and has no Maximum. Those within the Area of Effect and closest to the caster are affected first. A successful Resistance roll overcomes the spell, while a failed roll results in the victim suffering from one of the following random effects, roll every Round for the spell's Duration, or until the victim wanders off.

| **D100** | **Effects of Confusion** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01-10 | Attack the caster with either ranged or melee weapons for the remainder of the Round |
| 11-50 | Stand confused, essentially choosing Dither for the remainder of the Round |
| 51-70 | Attack nearest enemy for the remainder of the Round |
| 71-80 | Attack nearest ally for the remainder of the Round |
| 81-90 | Wander off at Walk speed if unengaged for the Duration of the spell, otherwise Dither as for 11-50 above |
| 91-00 | Act normally for the remainder of the Round |

Each attack on a confused creature allows it an additional attempt to resist the spell. The victim can Evade or Parry normally.

With a 'Wander off' result, the victim heads in the opposite direction to the caster at a walking gait using their normal mode of movement. Creatures with innate Abilities such as astral or ethereal travel, plane shifting, and so on, have a 50% chance of using one of these Abilities in place of their mundane form of movement each Round.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to Confusion, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 min.; 1d4 creatures (1d3+1 for a cleric) |
| 2 | 4 | 2 min.; 2d4 creatures (2d3+2 for a cleric) |
| 3 | 5 | 3 min.; 3d4 creatures (3d3+3 for a cleric) |
| 4 | 6 | 4 min.; 4d4 creatures (max) (4d3+4 for a cleric) |
| 5 | 7 | 5 min.; (5d3+5 for a cleric) |

#### Continual Light

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Sun | **Duration:** Semi-Permanent (See Below) |
| **Cost:** 3 | **Range:** 180 ft. |
| **Area:** 60 ft. Radius | **Resist:** See Below |

This spell creates a globe of light equivalent in brightness to full daylight at a spot of the caster's choosing, which may be an object or even in thin air. It is semi-permanent and is only temporarily negated by entering an area of magical darkness. However, it may be permanently dismissed by the caster at any time or negated by a casting of Darkness or Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude of Continual Light.

Creatures with an aversion to daylight suffer the normal penalties associated with it when within the relevant Area of Effect. If cast upon a creature, the target is allowed a Willpower test to resist with a Success indicating that the spell has affected the area directly behind the creature and not the creature itself. If centered upon a creature's eyes, a failed Willpower roll results in partial blindness, increasing the difficulty of all skill and Resistance rolls requiring sight by one grade. Sight may only be restored by casting Cure Blindness and Deafness at any Intensity, or by casting Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude of Continual Light. The effects of the spell are immobile but can be cast on a portable or movable object.

| **Sphere:** Weather | **Duration:** 1d6 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 1d4 square miles/Intensity | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster to alter the current weather in a significant and noticeable way. Once cast, another 1d4x10 Minutes must pass for the effects to completely manifest. The Duration of any change is calculated according to the spell's Duration.

#### Coordination

(Transmutation)

| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** All | **Duration:** Trigger |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** None |

Coordination enhances manual dexterity and agility when performing a single predetermined task. When cast in preparation it permits the recipient a chance to re-roll a single skill check where coordination is required, such as Acrobatics, Lockpicking, and so on. The recipient may choose the better of the two rolls, but the spell is expended in the process.

#### Create Food and Water

(Alteration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Creation, Elemental (Water) | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft. |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** N/A |

The casting of this spell creates out of thin air, enough food to feed three creatures of SIZ 20 or less or one creature of SIZ 21-40 for an entire day per Intensity. Creatures larger than SIZ 40 require 1 Intensity per 'meal' instead. This creation resembles normal food in all ways, and while rather bland, may be of anything the caster desires. What it lacks in flavor, it more than makes up for in nourishment. Once created, the food has a shelf life of 24 hours regardless of how it is stored. However, once it has gone bad, it may once again be made edible with the casting of Purify Food and Water, extending the period in which it may be safely eaten by another 24 hours. In addition to the food created, the spell creates plenty of drinking water, functioning in all ways as the Rank 1 spell Create Water.

#### Cure Disease  \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

This spell cures the effects of any mundane or magical disease afflicting the target whose Potency is less than the spell's Intensity x30. Once the cure is in effect, recovery can begin as per that noted in the write-up of the disease in question. Afflictions imparted by parasitic creatures such as green slime, rot grubs, and even lycanthropes, can be nullified by Cure Disease. However, with regards to the latter afflictions, Remove Disease must be cast within 72 hours and at an Intensity of 12 or greater, while the former may be cured at an Intensity of only 1. This spell offers no future immunization to the disease.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Cure a POT 30 disease, green slime, or rot grubs |
| 2 | 6 | Cure a POT 60 disease |
| 3 | 9 | Cure a POT 90 disease |
| 4 | 12 | Cure a POT 120 disease, lycanthropy |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

The reverse of this spell, Cause Disease, inflicts a magical malady on an enemy. If successful, the caster may choose to inflict any known disease upon the target; however, the Intensity x30 must equal or exceed the Potency of the chosen disease. Once the disease has been successfully inflicted, it functions as per any other disease with regards to resistance, Onset Time, Duration, and so on. The only exception being that early recovery is limited to the casting of either Remove Disease or Cure. The Healing skill has no effects on magically inflicted diseases.

#### Cure Fatigue  \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 2 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

When this spell is cast, the subject regains 1d3+1 lost levels of Fatigue, even regaining consciousness if applicable.

The reverse of this spell, Cause Fatigue, imparts 1d3+1 levels of Fatigue to targets failing an Endurance roll. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor negates the spell.

---
#### Cure Major Wounds  \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

This spell functions as per Cure Minor Wounds except where noted below.

This spell heals a single Hit Location suffering from a Major Wound, no matter whether it has been crushed or mutilated. It has no effect on a dismembered limb, which requires either Heal, if the limb is still present, or Regeneration to restore it. Provided the recipient is still alive and the location was wounded within a number of hours equal to the Intensity of the spell, then Cure Major Wounds heals 1d8+4 damage almost instantly.

If the injury took place earlier, then the body part must undergo a more traumatic repair, which requires a single casting of Cure Major Wounds and a number of days of full rest and recovery equal to the character's Healing Rate. The rolled Hit Points are averaged out and regained over the course of the noted Recovery Period. If this Recovery Period is interrupted before the healing has completed, the location remains maimed and unusable, only able to be cured by the spell Heal.

When reversed, Cause Major Wounds may be used to reduce a single Hit Location by 1d8+4 Hit Points. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

#### Cure Minor Wounds  \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3 (or 1) | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

Cure Minor Wounds has several different effects depending on the nature of the ailment it is being used on. When cast on a creature suffering a Minor Wound, 1d4+1 Hit Points in the injured location are healed instantly. It has a limited effect on Serious and Major Wounds, with only a single Hit Point being recovered. However, the spell stabilizes a location regardless of damage, stopping all bleeding and preventing imminent death.

Alternately, if the subject is suffering from a minor complaint, such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts or so on, the casting of Cure Minor Wounds lifts one of the effects. This instance of the spell costs but a single Magic Point.

When reversed, Cause Minor Wounds reduces the touched location's Hit Points by 1d4+1 points, but otherwise operates in the same manner. Cause Minor Wounds will only inflict 1 point of damage to a location with a Serious or Major Wound, while excess damage is lost. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally.

Alternately, the spell may cause a minor malady, such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts or so on. This instance of the spell costs but a single Magic Point.

The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

This spell functions as per Cure Minor Wounds except where noted below.

Cure Serious Wounds heals one Hit Location of 1d6+2 points of injury, provided the injury is no more severe than a Serious Wound. It has a limited effect on Major Wounds, healing the location for 2 Hit Points and stabilizing the injury, preventing death.

When reversed, Cause Serious Wounds reduces a single Hit Location by 1d6+2 Hit Points. Cause Serious Wounds will only cause 2 points of damage to a location with a Major Wound; any excess damage is lost. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

#### Dancing Lights

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |

| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 100 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user can create one of the following effects: 1d4 flickering points of light that resemble lanterns or torches, which give off a similar amount of illumination, 1d4 glowing spheres of light-like will-o-wisps, or 1 vaguely humanoid shape of flickering light like that of a fire elemental. The effects may be directed by the caster with no need of Concentration and move at any speed desired within the spell's area. If the lights move out of the spell's Area of Effect, or the Duration expires, they wink out of existence.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 2 min. in a 100 ft. radius |
| 2 | 2 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 4 min. in a 200 ft. radius |
| 3 | 3 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 6 min. in a 300 ft. radius |

#### Darkness

(Transmutation)

| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 10 ft. Radius | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell creates an area of total magical darkness in a 10-foot radius, blocking normal vision as well as special racial sight like Infravision. All forms of mundane light are nullified by this spell, from sunlight to candlelight. It may be countered by the casting of Light and vice versa; however, other forms of magical light such as Dancing Lights, Fairy Fire, and even the glow given off by Detection spells are nullified by Darkness. A Light spell with an already ongoing Duration has no effect on Darkness and vice versa.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 10 min.; 30 ft. Range |
| 2 | 2 | 20 min.; 60 ft. Range |

| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell grants the recipient Darkvision to a Range of 60 feet. It functions in all ways as the racial Ability of the same name.

#### Death Spell

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instantaneous |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity, +2 EXP | **Range:** 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 15 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Endurance |

The successful casting of this spell kills a variable number of creatures SIZ 40 or less in the Area of Effect. The magic-user rolls 1d6 for each level of Intensity to determine the number of creatures affected. Where creatures of differing SIZ categories occupy the Area of Effect, human-sized creatures (SIZ 1-20) are always affected before larger ones. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are more likely to resist being killed, with their Resistance roll being Easy, however, each Large creature counts as 5 human-sized creatures. Creatures larger than SIZ 40 are unaffected by this spell.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 +2 EXP | 30 ft. Range; 1d6 creatures affected |
| 2 | 4 +2 EXP | 60 ft. Range; 2d6 creatures affected |
| 3 | 5 +2 EXP | 90 ft. Range; 3d6 creatures affected |
| 4 | 6 +2 EXP | 120 ft. Range; 4d6 creatures affected |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

Casting the spell at sufficient Intensity to equal or exceed the number of potential targets is desirable, as insufficient points are lost. This spell has no effect on lycanthropes, undead, or other planar creatures. Only a Wish can bring those affected by this spell back from the dead.

_Example: Rengarth casts the Death Spell into an area occupied by four SIZ 16 orcs and two SIZ 32 hill giants, choosing an Intensity of 3. Rolling 3d6 for the spell's effects, with 1d6 per Intensity, results in 12 points. While each hill giant requires only 5 points to be killed, the smaller orcs are the first affected. Three of the four orcs fail their Resistance roll and succumb to death. As each orc is equal to 1 point, 8 points remain. This is enough to affect a single hill giant for 5 points, with the remaining 3 points being lost. However, the angry hill giant has no problem succeeding at its Easy Resistance roll and charges at Rengarth._

Deflect wards the recipient against tiny impacts of foreign material, such as raindrops, a cloud of midges, or even flying grains of sand. The protection is limited to individual objects smaller than a child's fingernail, and thus cannot prevent normal missile weapons from striking a character.

#### Detect Charm \(R\)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target per Minute | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster to discern if one or more selected creatures are under the effects of Charm. A full minute's Concentration is required to scan one creature. When the reverse of this spell (Hide Charm) is cast, one creature may be shielded from such detection for 6 hours/Intensity.

#### Detect Evil \(R\)

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** All | **Duration:** 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 180 ft. |
| **Area:** 90-degree Arc | **Resist:** N/A |

With this spell, the caster can detect strong emanations of evil within a 90-degree arc, out to 180 feet. It will only discover evil creatures of a supernatural nature like demons and vampires, or mundane beings of either evil or vile intention, as determined by the Games Master. It will not, however, detect such things as traps, poison, cursed items, or so on. The caster can see the emanations through up to 3 feet of solid wood, 1 foot of stone or dirt, and 1 inch of solid metal. Because the magical auras need time to form, no more than one 60° arc may be scanned per minute. The reverse of this spell, Detect Good, follows the same rules noted above.

#### Detect Invisibility

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Line of Sight | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user gains the ability to see any objects or beings that are invisible. This includes those that are hidden, ethereal, astral, or out of phase. It may also detect those hidden or concealed by mundane means. Unlike other Detect spells, Detect Invisibility is limited to line of sight and does not require a minute to scan an arc of vision.

---
#### Detect Lie \(R\)

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Deceit |

When cast, this spell determines whether one being is knowingly lying or otherwise withholding the truth. The actual truth is not revealed, however, only that the answers being provided are not accurate. The target may still attempt to 'beat' the spell, with a Formidable Opposed Roll of their Deceit, vs. the original casting roll. The spell may be reversed, if so, Conceal Lie prevents detection of lies by magical means for a period of 6 hours per Intensity.

#### Detect Magic

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1, Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** All | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 90-degree Arc, 60 ft. | **Resist:** N/A |

When cast, the magic-user sees a glowing blue aura surrounding any magic item or spell effect within a 90-degree arc, out to 60 ft. This spell will also detect approximate Intensity and Magnitude as shown on the following table.

**Intensity and/or Magnitude Detected**

| **D100 Roll** | **Intensity/Magnitude** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01-25 | -1d3 |
| 26-75 | Exact Intensity/Magnitude |
| 76-00 | +1d3 |

There is a 10% chance per Intensity of discovering the specific type of magic (necromancy, elemental, and so forth). The aura the caster sees projects through solid objects, up to 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, and 1 inch of solid metal. Because the magical auras need time to form, no more than one 60° arc may be scanned per minute. Demons, devils, angels, and elementals are not magical in and of themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell will register for a number of minutes equal to the summoning spell's Magnitude x10 where it was cast.

---
#### Dimension Door

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** N/A |

Dimension Door is a form of short-range teleportation. The caster instantly jumps up to 100 feet per Intensity without crossing the intervening space, with no chance of error. The desired location may either be visually seen or may be specified by direction: 40 feet straight ahead, 65 feet down, 45° to the left, and so on. Arriving in mid-air will result in falling damage unless saved by a spell such as Feather Fall, while accidentally jumping into a solid object will instead trap the caster in the Astral Plane. All physically carried equipment (non-living, inanimate matter) jumps along with the caster. Living matter of no more than 20 SIZ may accompany the caster. For example, a character of SIZ 11 may jump along with the caster assuming both are touching. The caster, and any living creature transported as well, requires a full Round to recover. If attacked during this time, such individuals may do no more than defend.

---
#### Dispel Magic

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 360 ft. |
| **Area:** 15 ft. Radius | **Resist:** N/A |

Dispel Magic may be cast against either a specific target or a noted area, and once cast, all magic within a 15-foot radius of the target point is susceptible to dismissal. It ends ongoing spells on its target but does nothing to other magical effects. It has no effect on magical creatures or the undead. Dispel Magic eliminates all other magic in the Area of Effect with a Magnitude less than the spell's Intensity. The exception to this would be magic items and victims of beguiling-type spells such as Charm Person, which must be targeted individually. A spell's effects cannot be partially eliminated.

Dispel Magic starts with the most powerful magic in the Area of Effect. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's Magnitude is too high), then the spell ends, and no more magic can be eliminated.

Dispel Magic may be used defensively to neutralize incoming offensive spells, by using the Counter Spell Reactive Action.

#### Divination

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** N/A |

When cast, this spell allows clerics to receive information from their deity regarding some so far untaken activity expected to occur in no more than one week. Unlike the less powerful spell Augury, Divination provides specific information. The Channel skill roll to cast this spell starts at Formidable, and each level of Intensity decreases the difficulty by one grade. The Intensity cannot exceed level 5, and a roll of 96% or higher always fails.

The Games Master should make this roll for the player as there are some instances where magic hostile to the caster could be at work, and in these instances, a Failure could reveal false information.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Spell cast at Formidable difficulty |
| 2 | 6 | Spell cast at Hard difficulty |
| 3 | 9 | Spell cast at Standard Difficulty |
| 4 | 12 | Spell cast at Easy difficulty |
| 5 | 16 | Spell cast at Very Easy difficulty |

#### Dry

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A |

Dry removes all extraneous moisture from an object or person, either slicking off to form a puddle or evaporating in a cloud of vapor. It is normally used to dry off after heavy rain or help protect equipment from rotting but has several other versatile uses. The caster can dry an object up to POW x2 in SIZ.

---
#### Earthquake

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5, Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Elemental (Earth) | **Duration:** 1 Minute |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 10 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** N/A |

Earthquake causes a ground tremor capable of knocking people from their feet and collapsing rigid buildings. At the very minimum, failing to resist the spell causes the victim to fall prone. If located within a building, built up area or some vulnerable location (such as a forest or beneath a cliff), failing to Evade also indicates that the person is struck, and trapped by falling debris. Use the size of the damage dice in a Contest of Strength (see Brawn) to determine the difficulty of being extracted from the wreckage. Worn armor offers half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** | **Potential Damage** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 50 ft. Range; 10 ft. radius; Delicately balanced objects topple, suspended objects swing. | None |
| 2 | 4 | 100 ft. Range; 20 ft. radius; Walls and buildings creak. | None |
| 3 | 5 | 150 ft. Range; 30 ft. radius; Plaster and glass windows crack, trees and other tall objects quiver dramatically. | None |
| 4 | 6 | 200 ft. Range; 40 ft. radius; Heavy furniture moved, wall mounted objects fall, cracks open in walls. | None |
| 5 | 7 | 250 ft. Range; 50 ft. radius; Modest buildings of earth, wattle and daub or mud brick partially collapse. Minor branches fall. | 1d2 damage to a single location |
| 6 | 8 | 300 ft. Range; 60 ft. radius; Heavy furniture overturned. Buildings of earth, wattle and daub or mud brick destroyed. Buildings of solid timber or masonry partially collapse. Fall of columns, statuary, and boundary walls. Major tree limbs fall. | 1d4 damage to a single location |
| 7 | 9 | 350 ft. Range; 70 ft. radius; Modest buildings collapse. Ground cracks conspicuously, rockfalls from steep slopes. Underground pipes and sewers broken. Wooden bridges collapse. Small trees topple. | 1d6 damage to a single location |
| 8 | 10 | 400 ft. Range; 80 ft. radius; Well-constructed buildings collapse. Large-scale fortifications, city walls and stone bridges damaged. Ground badly cracked. Landslides and avalanches considerable. Big trees topple. | 1d8 damage to two locations |
| 9 | 11 | 450 ft. Range; 90 ft. radius; Few, if any, structures remain standing. Tunnels and caves collapse. Broad fissures in ground. Huge trees topple. | 1d10 damage to three locations |
| 10 | 12 | 500 ft. Range; 100 ft. radius; Total destruction, even colossal stone monuments suffer partial collapse. Cliffs and mountain flanks shatter. | 1d12 damage to four locations |

#### Enchant Item

(Enchantment)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** See Below |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3 + See Below | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Item | **Resist:** N/A |

The casting of this spell prepares an item for Enchantment. The object must be in good condition and of the finest construction and workmanship. An additional cost of at least 100GP is required to cover the cost of additional tooling, carving, embroidery, bejeweling, engraving, and so. Finally, the Enchantment process requires a laboratory or workshop.

While casting the spell, the magic-user must be touching the item throughout the entire Casting Time of 1d8+2 days. This accounts for periods of rest and sleep, during which time the item must remain within an arm's length of the caster. At no time throughout the casting may the magic-user cast another spell or perform any other form of magic. Breaking any of these strictures will automatically cause the spell to fail.

Once successfully cast, the item is ready for the final step, with the caster placing the desired spell into it. To do so, they must have the spell in memory or on a scroll and cast it into the item within 24 hours, or the entire process will need to be started over from scratch. Once the casting of the selected spell begins, the process may exceed the above-mentioned 24 hours. Imbuing the item with the selected spell costs the normal number of Magic Points for the desired Intensity and takes 1d12 hours per spell Rank. Throughout the imbuing process, the caster must remain touching the item or remain within arm's reach during periods of rest, as above, and an Arcane Casting roll is required at the end of the casting period to successfully imbue the spell. The normal Spell Casting degrees of success are followed, however, with regards to a Failure result, the spell cannot be forced. Successive spells may be imbued within the item, providing the casting process is started within 24 hours of the completion of the previous spell. This applies even in the case of a previously failed spell. Each successive spell requires the normal Casting Cost.

When using the item, each spell contained within may be cast only once, however multiple versions of the same spell may be imbued following the above procedure. It is also possible to imbue a single spell, following it with a casting of the Rank 4 spell Permanency. In this case, the spell may be cast as often as desired, following the restrictions set forth under the Permanency spell write-up.

It is not possible to imbue other magical effects into an item that do not conform to a specific spell, and many magic items from times long gone simply cannot be recreated in this day and age.

#### Enchant Weapon

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Weapon | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast while touching a normal weapon, the weapon is instilled with a temporary Enchantment granting a magical +1 Damage Modifier. This also allows an otherwise normal weapon to strike a creature only able to be harmed by weapons possessing at least a +1 Enchantment. The spell may be used to enchant two weapons equal in size to ½ a 'Thing' each, such as daggers, knives, arrows, and so on. Otherwise, no more than a single weapon may be enchanted per casting. An existing magic weapon may have its bonus increased by +1 to a total maximum combined bonus of +3. A weapon with a +3 bonus has its Size increased by one category for the purposes of inflicting damage: Large to Huge, Huge to Enormous, Enormous to Colossal. An Enchanted Weapon possesses +5 Armor Points and +2 Hit Points per +1 Enchantment for a weapon of its type. This spell may be combined with the spell's Enchant Item and Permanency to create a weapon with a lasting Enchantment.

#### Endure Heat/Cold

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** 90 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster to protect one creature from normal extremes of heat or cold, as determined when the spell is cast. The recipient of the spell is immune to mundane extremes of natural heat or cold, such as sub-zero temperatures or sweltering desert heat. Apart from Heat Metal, to which this spell offers complete protection, any 'attack' by magical heat or cold, such as a red dragon's flame breath or a mage's cone of cold spell automatically dispels the protection, regardless of which element was protected against at the time. However, the protected individual may ignore the first 10 points of damage in the Round in which the spell fails, assuming the protection fits the attack type. In the case of area effect spells, the damage is reduced before being applied.

---
#### Energy Drain

(Evocation or Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Endurance |

When cast, this spell imposes two levels of permanent Fatigue loss on the victim of a failed Resistance roll. Fatigue loss through Energy Drain is cumulative with normal Fatigue loss; therefore, opponents already weakened through combat or travel are more susceptible to Energy Drain. Cure Fatigue spells and potions do not affect Fatigue lost due to Energy Drain; however, Restoration spells and scrolls can permanently cure the lost Fatigue. Armor has no effect on Energy Drain.

---
#### Exorcism

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 1d10x100 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 10 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

By means of this spell, clerics call upon their deity to drive out a spirit or other supernatural force currently possessing a corporeal being such as in demonic possession. Exorcism may also be used against domination by certain objects and magic items, spells, curses, and even charms. Whether the possession is dominant, or covert is immaterial. The magic exorcises all forms of possession with an Intensity of up to half the Intensity of the spell. What occurs next depends on the attitude and type of entity, if any, but belligerent ones with the power to discorporate may be tempted to engage other nearby targets in Spirit Combat. Treat as a Magic Duel, however, if the entity wins, they may possess the loser. If the entity loses, it is sent back to its plane of origin. Thus, this spell can be potentially dangerous for the caster or their fellows. The Casting Time is very random and cannot be interrupted without disrupting the ritual.

---
#### Fear

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 5 ft. x 20 ft. Cone | **Resist:** Willpower |

When this spell is cast, a wave of terror expands outward, causing all those who fail a Resistance roll to flee in fear. Those so affected flee directly away from the caster at sprinting speed for a number of Rounds equal to the spell's Intensity x2. This terror is so all-consuming that those opponents who Fumble the roll to resist drop any held items that are not secured in some fashion. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

---
#### Feather Fall

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** Instant |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast, several people, creatures, or objects within the spell's Area of Effect, with a combined SIZ totaling no more than 20 per Intensity, are reduced in weight to that of a feather. Those under the spell's influence fall no faster than 10 ft. per Round/120 ft. per minute, with no falling damage incurred while the spell's Duration continues. They are so light as to be effectively immune to any knockback greater than 5 ft. and take no damage if knocked into anything, as they simply float slowly backward.

Casting this spell on an aerial creature such as a bird or dragon changes its flight dynamic in such a way that Hard Fly rolls are required every Round of the spell's Duration if they wish to remain aloft. On a success, the creature may move as desired, but at only half its normal Movement Rate, while a failed roll causes the creature's attempt to send it gently tumbling out of control in a random direction at a distance equal to its attempted rate of movement. If it simply lets itself fall, an aerial creature may use its wings to adjust its point of landing by 5 ft. per Round.

If the spell wears off before those affected have landed, they resume normal falling speed and determine falling damage from that point.

Due to this spell's Instant Casting Time, the mage may use Feather Fall reactively as well as proactively. This allows the spell to protect from unexpected falls or even to interrupt another's Action to slow-propelled projectiles such as arrows or hurled spears, which then gently float to the ground between the attacker and target, causing no damage.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 min.; 30 ft. Range; total affected 20 SIZ; total decent 120 ft |
| 2 | 2 | 2 min.; 60 ft. Range; total affected 40 SIZ; total decent 240 ft |
| 3 | 3 | 3 min.; 90 ft. Range; total affected 60 SIZ; total decent 360 ft |
| 4 | 4 | 4 min.; 120 ft. Range; total affected 80 SIZ; total decent 480 ft |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Find Familiar

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 2d12 Hours |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Special |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity, +1 EXP | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** ½ Mile Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell allows the caster to attempt to summon a familiar, which becomes an extension of its master's senses and power. Familiars may converse with their master telepathically and make good guards and scouts as well. Having one's familiar killed presents certain risks to the magic-user due to their close connection, which makes having a familiar a low-rank danger.

To summon a familiar, the magic-user must begin the ritual while keeping a brazier stoked with charcoal, and when burning with intensity, add 100GP worth of incense. With these ingredients burning, the caster must then continue the ritual until the familiar arrives or the Casting Time expires without success.

Even if this spell is successfully cast, the chance of a suitable familiar answering the magic-user's call is only 50%, and the magic-user may only attempt this spell once a year. Each additional level of Intensity beyond the first extends the Range of the spell another half mile, which in turn increases the likelihood of a potential familiar being found by 5%, to a maximum of 95%. There is no control over the exact type of creature that will answer the call, but what does arrive will be a faithful servant and ally. It is up to the specific creature to answer the call, therefore being in a region known to be inhabited by a certain type of creature does _not_ assure the caster of success.

If a creature answers the caster's summons, the magic-user need still sacrifice 1 Experience Roll to create a spiritual link between themselves and the familiar. Once this is done, the ritual is complete.

While the familiar and his master are within 120 ft. of each other, the magic-user gains the ability to use the familiar's Magic Points as well. In addition, the magic-user gains a telepathic link with the familiar and any additional special Abilities or skill bonuses noted on the tables below.

In the case of the familiar's death, the caster loses 5 Experience Rolls. A caster not currently having any Experience Rolls must forfeit all further Experience Rolls awarded until the balance is paid.

The type of familiar to appear, if any, is determined according to the following table. Under most circumstances, common familiars are not exceptionally large, being between SIZ 1-4, and use the Small Animal write-up.

##### Common Familiars

| **d100 Roll** | **Type** | **STR/SIZ** | **POW** | **Granted Special Abilities, all include Telepathic Link** |

#### Fireball

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Evade |

On the first Turn of casting, as the magic-user begins the verbal incantation and gestures, a small cinder or spark-sized flame begins to form in the hand, slowly enlarging to a small ball of fire. On the second Turn, the incantation complete, the magic-user mimes tossing the ball, which detonates with a low roar into a massive ball of fire. It possesses little pressure and delivers 1d6 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. The damage is rolled once and is applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll, resulting in going prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case will only reduce damage by half unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

A Fireball has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |

#### Fireball, Delayed Blast

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Evade |

With the exceptions noted both above and in the following text, this spell functions as per the normal Fireball spell. The Delayed Blast Fireball inflicts 1d8 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. When cast, the magic-user can set the Fireball to detonate at any time between instantly and within five minutes. It traverses to the designated spot and then remains inert, a tiny floating cinder, until at the desired time when it flashes into a massive ball of flame.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 50 ft. Range; 1d8 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 100 ft. Range; 1d8 damage |

| 4 | 6 | 200 ft. Range; 2d8 damage |

#### Fire Shield

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** N/A |

This spell creates a shield of wispy flames that immolates the caster or one other person but causes no damage in and of itself. Instead, the flames protect the recipient from either fire or cold, dependent upon which of two variants is in memory: Chill Shield, which creates blue or green flames and protects against heat and fire-based damage, or Warm Shield, which creates violet or blue flames and protects against cold and ice-based damage. The color of the flames should be determined randomly with a 50% chance of either, as the fact that both types can emit blue flames creates an element of uncertainty on the part of any attacker. The decision as to which to memorize is made when spells are prepared, and both may be memorized if desired. These flames give off no heat and shed light at only half the brightness of a torch. The specifics of each variant are detailed below.

- **Chill Shield:** These flames are cool to the touch and reduce any fire or heat-based damage to half the total. A successful Resistance roll will negate all damage. The Resistance roll is one grade easier and, in the case of Evade, will not render the defender prone.
- **Warm Shield:** These flames are warm to the touch and reduce any cold-based damage to half of the total. A successful Resistance roll will negate all damage. The Resistance roll is one grade easier and in the case of Evade, will not render the defender prone.

Melee attacks against the recipient of either variant, whether armed or unarmed, inflict normal damage unless using one of the elements protected against. In this case, the caster is protected from the elemental portion of the attack, and the attacker receives damage equal to that inflicted. Worn armor on the part of the attacker offers no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. Creatures with Innate Magic Resistance can dispel Fire Shield on a successful Willpower roll when the recipient is first struck. If the Magic Resistance roll fails, the opponent cannot later negate the Fire Shield.

#### Flame Strike

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Combat, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration:** Instantaneous |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft.+20ft./additional Intensity |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Evade |

Upon successfully casting, a column of flame 30 feet in height streaks down from above, scorching an area the cleric designates. The column does 1d8 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. Roll the damage once and apply it to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural amour reduce damage as normal. A successful Evade roll, rolling or throwing oneself out of the Area of Effect and ending up prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone and is allowed to freely move just outside of the Area of Effect.

Flame Strike has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |

#### Flesh to Stone \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

When cast, one victim within Range is allowed a Willpower Resistance roll. If unsuccessful, they and all carried and worn belongings are completely transformed into solid stone. This transformation is not death, but instead a form of suspended animation. The casting of either the reversed version of this spell, or a Wish, may be used to restore the victim to life once again. Any damage the victim suffers while stone carries over, taking effect immediately upon restoration. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

The reverse of this spell, Stone to Flesh, is used to restore a victim and no roll to resist is necessary. However, the spell may also be reversed to transform stone that was never previously alive; being used in one of several creative ways. For example, a wall of stone 10 cubic feet in size per level of Intensity may be transformed into soft flesh, a 'tunnel' of flesh up to 3 feet wide, with a length of 10 feet per Intensity could be created, a single target such as a stone statue could be transformed into a body, and even a stone golem could be transformed into a flesh golem by means of this spell. However, in the latter case, the stone golem would be allowed a Willpower roll to resist as normal. Stone turned to flesh in this way is soft. and pliable, and while it retains its actual Hit Points, possesses no Armor Points, thus making it easier to hack apart.

#### Floating Disk

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 30 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft. |
| **Area:** 3 ft. wide disk | **Resist:** N/A |

The magic-user may cast this spell to create a shimmering disk of force concentrated into a circle 3 feet in diameter, and use it to carry loose, miscellaneous items. This floating disk will always remain 3 feet above the ground and can carry any number of goods if they do not exceed 20 'Things' per Intensity and can fit upon the disk. For comparative purposes, assume 1 SIZ is equal to 3 'Things'; therefore, the disk would be able to carry just over 6 SIZ per Intensity. The concave nature of the disk will generally keep items from rolling off and if left unbidden, the disk will stay within 5 feet of the caster, following with a Movement Rate of 15 feet. However, the disk may be maneuvered to any point within the 60-foot area of the spell if the magic-user concentrates, even being willed to remain at a certain location. If the magic-user allows the disk to move beyond 60 feet, the disk will wink out of existence, dropping all carried items to the ground. The disk may not be willed to rise more than 3 feet off the ground.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 30 min.; carry 1-20 'Things' |
| 2 | 2 | 60 min.; carry 21-40 'Things' |
| 3 | 3 | 90 min.; carry 41-60 'Things' |
| 4 | 4 | 120 min.; carry 61-80 'Things' |

#### Fly

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 30 Minutes/Intensity, +1d6x10 Minutes |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user may grant one creature of up to 10 SIZ per Intensity the gift. of flight. The creature gains a Movement Rate of 30 feet while flying, half that if climbing and double that in a dive. All skill penalties applying to ground movement speed apply to the desired flying speed as well, including limitations placed on spell casting and combat. The exact Duration of the Fly spell is unpredictable and should be rolled by the Games Master as those under its effects should not know specifically how much time is left. If the flier is required to make a Fly skill roll, Athletics or Acrobatics may be substituted at two grades of difficulty. However, a character that uses this spell frequently may choose to develop the Fly skill normally at a Base Value of STR+DEX.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 30 min. +1d6x10 min.; 1-10 SIZ |
| 2 | 4 | 60 min. +1d6x10 min.; 11-20 SIZ |
| 3 | 5 | 90 min. +1d6x10 min.; 21-30 SIZ |

#### Free Action

(Abjuration, Enchantment)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** N/A |

When cast, this spell allows the subject to act normally throughout its Duration, regardless of other spells or effects that hinder movement or penalize attacks. This includes negating penalties from impeding terrain such as mud and snow. Under water, the subject may move at their normal land speed and swung weapons (swords, axes, clubs, maces, and so on) attack with full effect. This spell does not grant the ability to breathe under water, however. This spell negates hindering spells, such as Entangle, Slow, Hold, Paralysis, Web, and so on, regarding movement and action penalties.

#### Frostbite

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 60 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Endurance |

Frostbite works directly on living, organic tissue, inflicting numbness, and pain in one of the recipient's extremities, for example fingers, toes, buttocks, nose & ears, and so on. The caster must either touch a specific extremity or roll randomly if cast at Range. If the spell is not resisted the area affected suffers sensory numbness followed by lingering pain for the Duration, making skill tests utilizing that location one Difficulty Grade harder. Frostbite does not deal direct damage but makes the affected area of limited use for a while. For instance, a victim suffering frostbite to the buttocks cannot sit without extreme discomfort.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

#### Fumble

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area:** 10 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell causes all opponents in the Area of Effect to become clumsy, with any physical skill rolls becoming one grade more difficult and causing all failures to result in a Fumble. Even physical actions that do not typically require a skill roll such as picking up a dropped item, moving faster than a walk, or climbing stairs require an Athletics skill roll. A Failure in this case results in a Fumble, and typically an awkward fall in the case of movement, or accidentally kicking an item further away while attempting to pick it up. The Games Master should be creative with the results of a Fumbled roll; however, few should be outright deadly in non-combat situations. In combat, however, a Fumble is treated as any other and can result in Special Effects as normal.

A successful Resistance roll allows the victim to avoid the effects of the spell for the current Round; however, if the victim still occupies the Area of Effect next Round, another roll to Resist must be made again as normal. Allies of the original attacker will also need to stay out of the Area of Effect or suffer the same limitations as their opponents.

This spell may also be targeted on a specific creature, who will suffer the effects for the spell's entire Duration on a failed Resistance roll. Cast in this way, Fumble produces no Area of Effect. In this case, a successful Resistance roll results in the victim suffering the effects of the Rank 2 spell, Slow.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 Round; 30 ft. Range |
| 2 | 4 | 2 Rounds; 60 ft. Range |
| 3 | 5 | 3 Rounds; 90 ft. Range |
| 4 | 6 | 4 Rounds; 120 ft. Range |

#### Gate

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5, Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Rounds |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Summoning | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity,+3 EXP | **Range:** 100 ft. |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Willpower |

The casting of Gate requires the caster to know the true name of the entity to be summoned, which is typically a creature from one of the other planes of existence, such as a demon or devil, an angel, demigod or even a god. When successfully cast, a portal opens between the caster's plane of occupancy and that of the entity. Casting the spell automatically gains the entity's attention whether successful or otherwise. This spell is immensely powerful and draining, costing the caster not only the noted 3 Magic Points and 3 Experience Rolls, but also Aging them 5% of their typical lifespan (5 years in the case of a human caster). If the entity succeeds at the Resistance roll, they typically will not bother to come in person, however, assuming the spell is successful, 'something' will come through. The following table is used to determine some common entities, their average Willpowers, and typical servants that would be sent in their place. The Games Master is free to choose as best fits the nature of the current campaign.

**Extra Planar Entity Table**

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** | **Willpower** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Sub-Demon or Sub-Devil | As per specific entity |
| 2 | 4 | Minor Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 3 | 5 | Lesser Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 4 | 6 | Greater Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 5 | 7 | Demon/Devil Prince or Duke, Arch Angel, or Demi-god | 121-140% |
| 6 | 8 | Demon Lord, Arch-Devil, or Lesser Deity | 141-160% |
| 7 | 9 | Greater Deity | 161-180% |
| 8 | 10 | Ruling Deity | 181% + |

The form of the response will depend greatly on the specific entity, the Alignment of both parties, and the specifics of the request. If the entity believes the reasons for the interruption to be petty or inconsequential, their response could be anything from simply leaving to outright attack. However, a desperate situation, especially one where the caster is threatened by something strongly opposed by the entity is likely to be met with a more favorable response. If the Games Master feels there is a gray area, and the response would be in question, the caster and their allies may attempt to argue their case using a combination of skill, flattery, pleading, and/or bribery. However, most entities will avoid being drawn into a conflict with others of equal or greater power, and many will demand payment, either before or after the deed. The gate will stay open for as long as the entity chooses to remain on this side, closing behind them when they decide to leave. During this time, it is possible for the gate to be traversed by others, offering two-way travel between both realities.

#### Glamour \(R\)

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 60 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

Glamour makes the target alluring so that people are naturally attracted to them. The nature of the glamour must be chosen when cast, and can be anything from increased natural beauty, a softer sultrier voice, or even a seductively perfumed body scent. While the spell grants no mechanical benefits, it does ensure that the recipient will gain a chance to gather themselves an audience, engage the attention of someone they wish to contact, or provide a distraction enabling accomplices an opportunity to perform nefarious deeds.

When reversed, Repugnance twists the appearance of the target so that they cause distaste in all those that see, hear, or smell them. The effect must be chosen when cast and can be anything from a great wart on the end of a nose, a high-pitched nasal voice or even pungent body odor. Whatever is chosen, it will cause people to turn away from the victim or make excuses to leave their presence as quickly as possible.

#### Glue

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 24 Hours |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 2 Items or 1 Broken Item | **Resist:** N/A |

Glue cements together two solid, inanimate objects for the Duration of the spell, for example a cartwheel to its axle, or a door to its frame. While under the effects of the spell the items, no matter how disparate, cannot be parted unless something actively tries to wrench them apart. In this circumstance the spell has a Brawn skill equal to the caster's POW x5 and fails when a superior Brawn is set against it, defeating it in an Opposed Roll. Once the spell concludes or fails, the items part, completely unharmed.

---
#### Haste

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 180 ft. |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius, 1 Target/Intensity | **Resist:** N/A |

One person or creature (to include oneself) per Intensity within the spell's Area of Effect receives double the normal Movement Rate and gains a +4 bonus to Initiative for the spell's Duration. In addition, the target may choose 2 Actions per Turn for each Action Point used. This does not increase the rate of spell casting or the Duration of a spell in any way. Therefore, a spellcaster under the effects of Haste will not cast spells any faster, nor benefit from the extra Action in the same Turn that spells are cast. Because of the subject's sped up metabolism, each casting of this spell will age the target 1% of their normal life expectancy, regardless of Duration. For humans, that would be about 1 year. See the [Aging](0007_Game_System.md?id=aging) rules for the average life expectancies of the demi-human races. The casting of Haste will cancel out the effects of Slow, and in this case, will not age the individual. Haste does not stack with itself or similar magical effects.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 Rounds; 1 target |
| 2 | 4 | 6 Rounds; 2 targets |
| 3 | 5 | 9 Rounds; 3 targets |
| 4 | 6 | 12 Rounds; 4 targets |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Heal  \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3 +1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Creature | **Resist:** N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

With the casting of Heal, the cleric can cure a physical malady, mental trauma, or a significant amount of injury with a single touch. The actual extent of this recovery is based on the Intensity of the spell as follows. For each level of Intensity, the spell heals the subject of one disease of any POT, cures any blindness or deafness, negates a mental disorder brought on by injury or magic, or heals a single Hit Location of up to 12 points of damage. It will not, however, restore a severed limb, as that requires a casting of the spell Regenerate. Each additional Intensity can be used to cure another malady or heal another Hit Location. It would therefore require a casting at Intensity 7 to heal an individual suffering burns to his entire body. Unlike lesser healing spells that limit their effectiveness against long-term injuries, there are no limits placed on the spell by the Duration in which the subject has suffered the effects of injury.

When reversed, Harm inflicts 12 points of magical injury to one of the victim's Hit Locations on a failed roll to resist. Alternately, a malady is inflicted upon them, the effects of which are the same as the spell Cause Disease, the reverse of Cure Disease, but at +20 POT. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage normally, and fully blocks inflicted maladies. Each additional Intensity affects another Hit Location contiguous to the first, with effects as determined by the initial Resistance roll. Neither version of this spell has any effect on the undead, creatures harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons, or non-corporeal beings.

#### Hold Person

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** 2 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 360 ft. |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to immobilize 1 humanoid creature per Intensity within the Area of Effect. A successful roll to resist completely negates the effects of the spell for that target only. Large humanoids (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to the Hold Person, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge humanoids (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. While held, affected creatures are completely helpless and nothing short of Dispel Magic will release them early.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 2 Rounds; 1 target |
| 2 | 4 | 4 Rounds; 2 targets |
| 3 | 5 | 6 Rounds; 3 targets |
| 4 | 6 | 8 Rounds; 4 targets |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Holy Word \(R\)

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Combat | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1 EXP | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 30 ft. Radius | **Resist:** N/A |

When this spell is cast, the cleric utters a word of incredible divine power, capable of repelling evil entities from other planes of existence; however, the caster must be in their own plane to do so. The affected creatures are sent back to their plane of origin and cannot return to the caster's plane for at least 24 hours.

In addition, non-planar creatures of Evil Alignment suffer additional effects dependent upon the entity's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **General** | **Skill\*\*** | **Movement** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Kills | - | - |
| 2 | 21-40 | Paralyzes 1d4 x10 Minutes | - | - |
| 3 | 41-60 | Slows 2d4 Rounds \*\*\* | Hard | ½ |
| 4-5 | 61+ | Deafens 1d4 Rounds | Formidable | ¼ |

_\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class._

_\*\* All skills, including combat, Resistance rolls, and spell casting._

_\*\*\* As per the Rank 2 Arcane spell, [Slow](0010_Spells.md?id=slow)._

Creatures that have been previously deafened or are otherwise unable to hear the spell are unaffected by the effects detailed in the table, however, other planar entities are still driven off as detailed above.

When reversed, Unholy Word functions as above, however only with regards to creatures of Good Alignment.

#### Ice Storm

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** See Below |

Ice Storm has two effects, one of which is chosen when the spell is cast:

Hail Stones (Duration: Instant): This variant of the spell causes large balls of hail to rain down in an area 60 feet in radius. Those caught in the area take 1d10 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof. Each die of damage is rolled individually and applied to random Hit Locations. Fire-using creatures take +3 damage from each hail strike, and cold-using creatures' take half damage. Worn armor offers only half protection, but a creature's natural armor (or magical or magical Armor Points) reduce damage as normal. An Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, is only effective if within 5 feet of cover or of the edge of the Area of Effect. Otherwise, it is impossible to escape damage. Success in Evading allows the victim to suffer half the damage of each roll. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, and if with 5 feet of cover or the edge of the Area of Effect, will take no damage on a successful roll, otherwise they take damage as normal.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 30 ft. Range; 1d10 dmg |
| 2 | 4 | 60 ft. Range; 1d10 dmg |
| 3 | 5 | 90 ft. Range; 2d10 dmg |
| 4 | 6 | 120 ft. Range; 2d10 dmg |
| 5 | 7 | 150 ft. Range; 3d10 dmg |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

Driving Sleet (Duration: 1 Round/Intensity): This variant of the spell creates a driving sleet that whips through a path-like area 60 feet wide, and 120 feet long, blinding those affected. The actual path may be designated by the magic-user when the spell is cast. In addition, the ground in the affected area ices over, slowing the Movement Rate by 50%, and grounding fliers that fail a Formidable Fly skill roll. Those on the ground must succeed at an Athletics roll every Round to resist falling prone, with the roll being two grades harder if moving faster than a walk. A character possessing Acrobatics may substitute that skill if desired. The ice will melt after the spell's Duration expires at a rate determined by the Games Master, dependent upon the ambient temperature; however, even in warm weather it will last a minimum of 10 minutes. Small fires, such as campfires and torches, are automatically extinguished. This spell will negate the effects of the spell Heat Metal.

#### Identify

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** NA |

With the casting of this spell the magic-user may attempt to identify the magical properties (if any) of one handled item or object. Simply touching the item is not typically enough, the item must be worn or held congruent with its design, e.g., a helm must be put on the head, an amulet slipped over the neck, a melee weapon firmly held, a ring placed on a finger, and so forth. If the Arcane Casting roll is successful, a follow-up Arcane Knowledge roll will identify one magical property possessed by the item. One Arcane Knowledge attempt may be made each minute that the Duration continues. If a property requires an activation word, this is also identified along with the property. Items with charges will reveal the total currently available, along with the normal maximum, as will items possessing a Magic Point matrix.

Cursed items are typically activated when a piece of equipment is first put on or used; therefore, the casting of this spell will subject the magic-user to the effects of any curse if present. If the Arcane Casting skill test is successful, the magic-user is allowed a Willpower test to avoid the effects of any curse. This does not dispel the curse on the object, however, but it does allow the caster to remove the item without being affected.

A pearl of at least 100GP value is ground into dust and consumed along with other mundane spell components to cast this spell. If a Luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the difficulty of the Arcane Casting roll is normal and all magical properties of any one item handled per minute throughout the spell's Duration are automatically learned, with no further rolls necessary.

#### Ignite \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Elemental (Fire) | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 10 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Small Fire | **Resist:** NA |

This spell may be utilized in two separate ways, either to Ignite or Extinguish. The choice of which is made when cast.

Ignite only works on flammable inorganic matter, causing a small object or hand-sized area to burst into flame. Depending on what was set alight, once burning, the flames may then spread unless quenched or countered in some way. This spell is normally used to light candles, torches, or lanterns from afar. It can also be used to start a camp or cooking fire in adverse conditions, such as using damp kindling or in strong winds.

Extinguish immediately quenches flames and small fires of modest size and heat. It is useful for dousing candles, lanterns, torches, or small cook fires, but it will not work on magical or larger, more ferocious conflagrations such as pyres, burning houses, or dragon flames.

---
#### Illusion

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Concentration; See Below |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 50 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** Disbelieve |

This spell creates a visual illusion of anything the caster desires. It has no effect on other senses, making no sound, producing no odor, temperature, or texture, and so on.

This illusion may be of anything from an open meadow to an ancient red dragon, if it fits within the spell's Area of Effect. The illusion will last only so long as the caster maintains Concentration, or once it an opponent touches or enters it; doing so causes the magic sustaining it to unravel and the illusion to dissipate. However, the caster may maintain the illusion after physical contact, by expending 1 Magic Point and directing it to react appropriately to the contact so as not to create suspicion. For example, under normal circumstances, the illusion of an ogre would wink out of existence when struck by an arrow; however, the caster could have the ogre appear to shrug off the hit and charge the attacker by spending 1 Magic Point. It should be noted that the actual arrow is not stopped by the illusion and may still hit something or someone behind the manifestation.

While no actual damage may be done by the illusion, nor any temperature created, the mind can be convinced that it feels pain, suffering the effects of injury, or feeling extremes of heat or cold; however, objects will not appear to freeze or combust, unless the caster concentrates on these effects as well. Once the spell has been cast, additional visual effects may be added by the magic-user at will by concentrating on the desired effect. This typically takes no time and may be handled as a Free Action. So, for example, if the caster wished to have a dropped illusionary torch cause dry leaves to appear to catch fire, the caster could concentrate as a Free Action to do so.

See the [Illusions and Phantasms](0009_Magic.md?id=illusions-and-phantasms) chapter for more information.

#### Invisibility

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 6 hours/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, the subject and any carried gear disappears, invisible to all forms of normal vision. This does not, however, render the individual undetectable by other means such as hearing, touch, smell, and so on, or by natural Abilities such as Life Sense or Sonar.

Those under the effects of Invisibility remain so throughout the spell's Duration (max. 24 hours), unless dispelled or the subject makes an attack, in which case the spell is nullified, and the individual reappears _after_ the attack. The target would be considered under the effects of [Surprise](0008_Combat.md?id=surprise). No other actions negatively affect the Duration of the spell, allowing the subject to open doors, talk, climb, run, pick a pocket, and so forth. Even the casting of spells will not end the Duration unless they negatively affect one or more specific enemies in combat. Many of the previously mentioned actions could allow other means of detection, such as a possible Perception check to hear someone running past, or to feel a pocket being picked. The Games Master will assign penalties or bonuses to those attempting the detection according to how noticeable it is.

#### Invisibility, 10 ft. Radius

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 6 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target, 10ft. | **Resist:** NA |

This spell functions identical to the [Invisibility](0010_Spells.md?id=invisibility) spell; however, all individuals within 10 feet of the recipient (which can be the caster themselves) when the spell is cast are rendered invisible as well. Those under the spell's effects can see each other; however, this does not grant the ability to see other invisible creatures. If any move out of the Area of Effect their Invisibility is lost, therefore, care must be taken to keep everyone within range of the original subject. Those moving back into the Area of Effect after their Invisibility has been lost, or having not been present when cast, do not benefit from its effects. Attacks made from the protection of Invisibility, including offensive spell casting by anyone other than the original subject, disrupt the Invisibility for that person but have no effect on other characters in the Area of Effect. However, an attack made by the original recipient of the spell renders everyone visible once again. See the basic [Invisibility](0010_Spells.md?id=invisibility) spell for further detail.

#### Invisibility, Greater

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

This spell functions as per the basic [Invisibility](0010_Spells.md?id=invisibility) spell; however, no action taken on the part of the subject will end the Duration early. The target may make melee or ranged attacks, cast spells, and so on. Note there are visible clues to the action having taken place, such as a visual distortion. This allows anyone with a line of sight on the subject to make a Formidable Perception roll after the action is taken, or possibly before if the character is delayed, to discern the location of the invisible attacker. An attack at one grade of difficulty may be made in the same Round the subject acted in by those who perceive the invisible person's location. See the spell [Invisibility](0010_Spells.md?id=invisibility) for further detail.

#### Ironhand

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** 10 Minutes |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** None |

Ironhand allows the recipient to hold anything that would otherwise cause damage (such as extremely hot or cold items, or those dripping acid) without causing themselves injury. Thus, a user could grasp a brand from a fire, lift. a bubbling cauldron from a spit, or even reach through a steam vent to grab an object on the other side. It does not grant total immunity from damage, it merely stops from conducting through the skin of the recipient's hands. The spell does not protect anything worn on the hand, so rings, gloves, and such will suffer the effects of the source.

#### Knock \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 180 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Portal | **Resist:** NA |

This spell may be cast to open one door or other similar aperture of wood, stone, or metal if locked, stuck, Held, or Mage Locked. It has no effect on a portcullis or gate. The door may possess up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, and can include locked chests or boxes, secret doors, and even shackles and chains. Even an aperture previously welded shut will break free of its bonds. A maximum of two different aspects may be affected by the casting of Knock, for example, a door that is barred, locked, and Held will require the casting of 2 Knock spells. Against Mage Locked doors, the Enchantment is simply suspended for 10 minutes after which it reverts to its magically locked state.

When reversed, Lock closes and locks one portal as noted above assuming there is a locking mechanism. Up to two different functions, lock, bolted, barred, and so forth, may be set.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | up to 25 HP portal; shackles, paddle locks, a typical wooden chest or door |
| 2 | 2 | up to 50 HP portal; a wooden reinforced chest or door |
| 3 | 3 | up to 75 HP portal; an iron chest or door |

#### Know Alignment \(R\)

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to discern the Alignment and Passions of one creature, which gets a roll to resist. If the roll to resist fails, the caster will divine the target's Ethical Code with respect to Law, Neutrality, and Chaos. Concentrating for a further Round is required to discern the target's moral Alignment with regards to Good, Neutrality, and Evil. Each additional Round beyond this will discern one other random remaining Passion. The Games Master reveals the 'strength' of the target's discovered Alignment and Passions according to the following table:

**Alignment/Passion Strength Table**

| **Percentage** | **Strength** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 01-29% | Weak |
| 30-69% | Average |
| 70-99% | Strong |
| 100% + | Very Strong |

The reverse of this spell, Obscure Alignment, makes a target's Alignment and Passions unreadable for 24 hours, even from the casting of Know Alignment or Detect Evil/Good.

#### Know Languages \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Sapient Being | **Resist:** NA |

This spell allows the caster to understand and read almost any non-magical language. The 'speech' of non-sapient animals or creatures is not understood, only the true languages of sapient beings. The magic-user must touch the object or creature to comprehend its meaning. This spell gives no ability to speak or write the language.

The reverse of this spell, Confuse Languages, makes a creature unintelligible to anyone or a piece of written text indecipherable. This reverse may also be used to counter Know Languages as it is being cast.

---
#### Levitate

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user may designate themselves, one target, a creature, or an object, of no more than 20 SIZ (+10 SIZ per additional Intensity), and levitate that individual off the ground. A creature other than the caster may be moved vertically at a speed of 5 feet per Combat Round; if cast on oneself, the caster may move vertically up to 10 feet per Round. Levitation requires no Concentration on the part of the caster other than when changing elevation. If used on an unwilling subject, the target is allowed a roll to resist. While the subject of this spell is not granted any form of horizontal movement, the subject may be able to pull along a wall or cliff if within reach. The caster may end this spell when desired.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 10 min.; 60 ft. Range; 20 SIZ |
| 2 | 4 | 20 min.; 120 ft. Range; 30 SIZ |

#### Light  \(R\)\*

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1, Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Sun | **Duration:** 1 Hour/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 180 ft |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** See Below |

When this spell is cast, a globe of light materializes at a spot of the caster's choosing, which may be upon an object, or even in thin air, and may be dismissed by the caster at any time. The spell has a Duration of 1 hour per Intensity. If cast upon a creature, the target is allowed a Willpower test to resist, with a Success indicating that the spell has affected the area directly behind the creature and not the creature itself. If Light is centered upon a creature's eyes, a failed Willpower roll results in partial blindness with a Duration equal to that of the spell, increasing all skill and Resistance rolls requiring sight by one Difficulty Grade. The effects of the spell are immobile but can be cast on a portable or movable object.

_\*The Divine version of this spell may be reversed, causing a sphere of utter and total darkness, which functions in all ways as the Arcane spell [Darkness](0010_Spells.md?id=darkness) with the exception that it possesses a lesser Duration of 30 minutes per Intensity._

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 20 ft. radius; 1 hour (30 min. reversed) |
| 2 | 2 | 40 ft. radius; 2 hours (1 hour reversed) |

#### Lightning Bolt

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 50 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 10 ft. wide path | **Resist:** Evade |

As the magic-user begins the verbal incantation and gestures on the first Turn of casting, an electrical charge begins arcing between their fingers. On the second Turn, the incantation complete, the magic-user sends a blast of lightning from the tip of a finger arcing in a straight line through all targets in a 10 ft. wide path running the Range of the spell. This damage causes 1d6 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. This damage is rolled once, and applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with both worn and natural armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll, resulting in throwing oneself prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case will only reduce damage by half, unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

Lightning has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x1%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information. Lightning may also shatter or destroy inanimate objects from sheer impact.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 50 ft. Range; 1d6 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 100 ft. Range; 1d6 damage |

| 4 | 6 | 300 ft. Range; 2d6 damage |

#### Locate Object \(R\)

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 60 ft/Intensity | **Resist:** NA |

With the casting of Locate Object, the caster is directed to a known or familiar item, sensing the direction to the object as the caster stands and slowly turns. The object must be within the spell's area of effect, however. The object may be any generic item such as a bed, chest, stairwell, or gold for example, and the spell will direct the caster towards the nearest representation of that object. Specific items on the other hand, such as Tashana's long sword, require that the caster have an accurate mental image, having either seen it in person within 30 feet, or through magical means. Therefore, a personal or unique item may not be located using this spell unless the caster is familiar with it. The spell cannot locate living or non-living creatures.

The reverse of this spell, Obscure Object, conceals one item from detection by magical means, such as crystal balls, Detect Magic, and so on, for the same Duration.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |

#### Mage Lock

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Portal | **Resist:** NA |

This spell may be cast on any lockable object such as a chest, door, portal, or even a lockable tome. The object, which may be up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, is permanently sealed unless battered open. Dispel Magic cast at an Intensity greater than the spell's Magnitude will only render it open for one Round, and Knock may be used to temporarily open a Mage Locked door for 10 minutes, after which the original spell continues. Finally, a magic-user of a higher Rank than the original caster may freely pass through a Mage Locked door without breaking the Enchantment, and they may even hold the portal for others. Unlike Secure Portal, Mage Locked objects are not automatically disrupted by creatures from beyond the prime material plane such as demons, devils, angels, and elementals, or those using material passing spells.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | up to 25 HP portal; shackles, paddle locks, a typical wooden chest or door |
| 2 | 4 | up to 50 HP portal; a wooden reinforced chest or door |
| 3 | 5 | up to 75 HP portal; an iron chest, door, or portcullis |
| 4 | 6 | up to 120 HP portal; a small castle gate |
| 5 | 7 | up to 150 HP portal; a large, reinforced castle gate |

#### Magic Missile

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 1-5 Targets | **Resist:** See Below |

When this spell is cast, one or more missiles of magical energy dart forth from the magic-user's fingertips and strike a target. The maximum number of missiles that may be generated is based on the caster's Arcane Casting skill level, with a second missile being generated at 60% skill, a third at 70%, fourth at 80%, and a fifth and final missile at 90%. To generate these missiles, the spell must be cast at an Intensity equal to the number of missiles desired. For example, at below 60%, a magic-user that casts Magic Missile at 3 Intensity would achieve the longer Range, however only a single missile will be generated. A magic-user of skill level 70% could cast the spell at the same 3 Intensity and attain the same Range but able to generate 3 missiles. This spell has a Maximum Intensity of 5. See the table below.

A Magic Missile will strike unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has partial cover. These missiles may not be evaded; however, an opponent in total cover cannot be targeted with this spell. The Shield spell will automatically deflect Magic Missiles assuming the target is aware and/or facing the caster. Magic Missiles do 1d6+1 points of damage and worn armor does not protect, but a creature's natural armor or magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Magic Missiles cause no damage to inanimate objects such as doors, locks, and so forth.

When shooting multiple missiles, the caster may have them strike a single creature, or target several creatures. Each Magic Missile will strike a random Hit Location - specific Hit Locations may not be targeted. The caster must designate individual targets of each missile before they roll for damage.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 100 ft. Range; 1 missile |
| 2 | 2 | 200 ft. Range; 2 missiles if 60% skill |
| 3 | 3 | 300 ft. Range; 3 missiles if 70% skill |
| 4 | 4 | 400 ft. Range; 4 missiles if 80% skill |
| 5 max. | 5 | 500 ft. Range; 5 missiles if 90% skill |

#### Magic Mouth

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Object | **Resist:** NA |

This spell creates a mouth on an item or object, which magically appears when triggered by a specific event or time appointed by the magic-user when the spell is first cast. This mouth will then speak whatever predefined phrase the caster chose at the time of the casting. This phrase must consist of no more than 25 words and are spoken by the mouth at a rate of roughly 1 word per second. The mouth may not speak words of power or cast spells.

This spell may be cast upon any normally inanimate object, from a pillar or tree, to a stone wall or a chest; however, it is particularly effective when cast on a statue, as the statue itself would look as if speaking. It cannot be cast on any living creature with any form of Intelligence or Instinct. This applies to those that were formerly alive. When casting this spell, the magic-user determines the situation that will activate the enchantment. It can be designed to trigger via anything from a spoken word to the creation of any noise. It could be as general as 'when the next person enters this room…' to as specific as, 'when a female Cleric of Sedona comes within 10 feet of the statue at the end of the hall on a Saturday…'. The triggering effect cannot be something that cannot be discerned non-magically, such as an invisible creature, a creature's Alignment, skill, Class, etc. However, it could designate clothing worn. The maximum distance that the spell can be triggered is 25 feet per Intensity.

This spell's Duration is permanent until the enchantment is activated and then the spell ends.

#### Magic Tricks

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 30 ft. Radius | **Resist:** None |

Magic Tricks are a great form of entertainment among the common folk, downtrodden, and most especially children. Some effects commonly created with Magic Tricks include puffs of wind to flicker candles, pulling a silver piece from behind a child's ear, causing a flower to quickly bloom, performing card tricks, creating eerie ethereal music that issues from nowhere, and so forth. Magic Tricks are unable to cause even a single point of damage or any amount of distraction in combat but could be used to keep a crowd occupied while the rest of the party sneaks past.

#### Meteor Shower

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instantaneous |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Evade |

When the magic-user casts this spell, two micro-meteors per level of Intensity streak from the outstretched hand. The meteors arc toward their target, impacting on a downward trajectory, leaving a trail of sparks and cinders in their wake. Upon impact, they detonate in multiple fiery explosions around the target point. The first meteor always strikes the targeted location, while any additional meteors strike randomly around it, each with an explosive radius of 30 feet. To determine where they hit, roll 1d8 for the direction.

| **4** | **5** | **6** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| **3** | **X** | **7** |
| **2** | **1** | **8** |

Each meteor does 1d10 points of fire damage to those in the Area of Effect. However, due to the radius of each explosion, many will overlap, doing additional damage to those unfortunate enough to get caught by them. The damage rolls are combined and applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case will only reduce damage by half, unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

Everyone, including those outside the Area of Effect but within 60 feet of an impact point, are required to succeed at an Athletics roll to remain standing.

Meteor Shower has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information.

| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Combat | **Duration:** Trigger |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |

Might allows the recipient to engage in an impressive act of physical brute force, by adding the caster's POW to the recipient's Brawn skill. It does not increase the character's Damage Modifier when inflicting combat damage.

#### Mirror Image

(Illusion)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, 2d4 duplicates of the magic-user appear within a 5 ft. radius, exactly mimicking the caster's movements. In addition, the entire Area of Effect wavers and shimmers, making the caster's exact location impossible to ascertain. Striking one of the illusionary images causes it to vanish; however, the remaining images are unaffected. Striking the caster has no effect on the remaining images and as the images are always shifting, there is no way of knowing if the target is the real caster if attacked again. Any injuries suffered by the caster are duplicated on the images as well. There are numerous ways the Games Master can determine if the actual caster has been struck or one of the images. One is to determine how many potential targets are available, including the caster, and roll a die of the closest denomination. For example, with 4 images and the caster, the attacker should roll 1d6, re-rolling a result of 6, with the caster being hit on a roll of 1. Another would be to have several markers equal to the number of potential targets, marking one as being the caster. A marker is drawn each time an attack is made and if the target is hit, damage is applied; otherwise, an image disappears, removing one of the markers. The images vanish at the end of the spell's Duration.

#### Neutralize Poison \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA (Endurance) |

This spell allows the caster to cancel the effect of poison or venom afflicting a creature and may be used to cure an individual that has 'died' of poisoning if used within 10 minutes of death. One level of Intensity is required per 30 Potency of the inflicting poison. Neutralize Poison may also be used to nullify the venom produced by a poisonous creature such as a snake or scorpion so that it will not be capable of poisoning others: this requires 1 Intensity per 30 Potency and when used in this way, has a Duration of 24 hours. Finally, Neutralize Poison may be used on poisoned or otherwise tainted substances, treating 5 lbs. of solids or 2 gallons) of liquids per Intensity.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | Cure victim of POT 1-30 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 1-30; treat up to 5 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 2 gallons of liquid |
| 2 | 4 | Cure victim of POT 31-60 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 31-60; treat up to 10 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 4 gallons of liquid |
| 3 | 5 | Cure victim of POT 61-90 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 61-90; treat up to 15 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 6 gallons of liquid |
| 4 | 6 | Cure victim of POT 91-120 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 91-120; treat up to 20 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 8 gallons of liquid |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

When reversed, Inflict Poison allows the caster to produce a deadly toxin in a victim. This venom is detailed below.

#### Arcane Poison

- **Application:** Contact
- **Potency:** equal to Intensity x30
- **Resistance:** Endurance
- **Onset Time:** 1d2+1 Rounds
- **Duration:** 1d3x10 Minutes
- **Conditions:** Victims begin with Agony lasting 2 Rounds before Asphyxiation strikes, usually resulting in death, unless magically treated with either Slow or Neutralize Poison.
- **Antidote/Cure:** None short of magical treatment.

#### Part Water

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Elemental (Water) | **Duration:** 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** NA |

This spell allows the caster to part water or other forms of liquid, creating a safe path which may then be traversed if desired. The spell creates a trough 100 feet wide, with a depth of 10 feet per Intensity, and a length of 120 feet per Intensity. Therefore, if cast at an Intensity of 4, the parting would be 70 feet deep, 480 feet long, with a width of 100 feet. The spell can be ended early by the caster, otherwise it continues until its Duration expires. This spell can be cast underwater, which instead creates a "corridor" of air with the same dimensions noted above. Finally, Part Water may be cast offensively on a creature such as a water elemental, and if so, causes 10 points of damage for every level of Intensity. Assuming the entity survives, it must succeed at a Willpower Resistance roll or flee the caster for 3d4 minutes.

#### Permanency

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +2 EXP | **Range:** See Below |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** NA |

The casting of this spell changes the Duration of certain other spells to Permanent. To use this spell, the magic-user will first cast the spell to be made permanent. However, upon finishing the casting of that spell it is held back, and an additional Action Point is spent casting Permanency, after which the selected spell is cast in its permanent form. Each spell made permanent costs the caster 2 Experience Roll as well as the noted 3 Magic Points, in addition to the normal Casting Cost of the original spell. Having Dispel Magic cast during the casting of Permanency not only dispels Permanency, but the original spell as well.

Permanency is also a key application in the creation of magic items using the spell Enchant Item. In addition to the spells noted below, other spells may be made permanent with the permission of the Games Master.

The following personal spells, those which only affect the caster, will benefit from this spell. They may not be made permanent on other creatures:

- Avert	
- Coordination
- Darkvision	
- Deflect	
- Detect Evil
- Detect Invisibility
- Detect Magic
- Glamour
- Know Languages
- Might
- Preserve
- Protection (Self)
- Protection from Evil
- Read Magic
- Tongues


The Permanency spell may also be used to make the following spells, which are cast on other creatures, objects, or areas, permanent. Spells marked with as asterisk may only be made permanent on an object or area.

- Chill
- Cleanse
- Dancing Lights\*
- Fear
- Invisibility
- Polish \*
- Preserve
- Tidy \*
- Magic Mouth \*
- Wall of Fire\* 
- Web \* |

#### Pet

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Animal | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Animal | **Resist:** Willpower |

Pet allows the caster to take mental control of a small creature, sending it off to scout, fetch, or perform some other complex task. It can be cast on any creature neither of whose SIZ and INS Characteristics may exceed half the caster's CHA. If the targeted creature is already the loyal pet of the caster, it does not need to resist the spell. While concentrating, the caster may access the animal's senses (sight, smell, hearing, and so on)

#### Plane Shift

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Astral | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** Willpower |

When cast, the cleric and up to 7 others (one per additional level of Intensity) can travel to another plane of existence. Everyone must be touching and forming a circle while the cleric casts the spell. In addition, the caster may also use the spell to transport one creature independent of themselves, willing or otherwise, to a plane of the caster's choice; however, the unwilling can make a Willpower roll to resist, with a Success negating the spell. The precise point of arrival is seldom what the caster desires. If using a hex map, roll 1d6 to determine the direction and 1d10x10 for the distance in miles.

In addition to any generic material components, the casting of Plane Shift requires rods of various rare metals, each specially attuned to a plane of existence. These rods are rare and easily valued at as much as 10,000GP each.

#### Polish

| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** None |

Polish instantly buffs one object - equal in 'Things' or SIZ of up to the caster's POW - to a high sheen making it glossy, shiny, and highly desirable, even if the quality of the article is sub-par. The item will lose its sheen normally overtime.

#### Polymorph Other

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity (+1 EXP) | **Range:** 15 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

The caster can alter the form of one corporeal targeted creature into that of another, with each point of Intensity altering SIZ by up to 5 points. Therefore, transforming an orc of SIZ 16 into a SIZ 1 rabbit would require 3 levels of Intensity (15 SIZ points of difference). The subject of this spell is allowed a Willpower roll to resist. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to being polymorphed, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

The entire transformation process takes a full Round and can be quite stressful to the creature in question, requiring a second Willpower roll to retain their original personality, with a Failure stunning the subject for 1d10 minutes, and a Fumble resulting in death from mental shock. Each doubling or halving of the creature's original SIZ makes the Willpower roll to retain the personality one grade more difficult, as would a complete change of environment, such as changing a person into a fish. A successful roll allows the victim to retain their INT and CHA as well as any skills requiring those Characteristics.

The transformation grants the recipient the assumed creature's form of breathing, if other than normal; any natural attacks; and all mundane modes of movement. It does not grant any heightened or magical Abilities possessed by the creature. For example, a creature that has been polymorphed into a dragon will not gain the creature's breath attack or spell-like abilities, but will gain the ability to fly, it's tough hide, deadly bite, claw attacks, and so on. In addition, the victim gains the new form's physical skills such as Athletics, Brawn, Fly, Swim, as well as its Hit Points and Damage Modifier. Assuming the transformed individual retained their INT, they still lose the capacity to speak, unless the new form possesses the ability to articulate words. Those that were able to cast spells in their previous form would still be able to cast in the new form, assuming they still possess the capability to produce the verbal and somatic components. In the case of a drastic change, such as being changed from biped to quadruped, or a land animal to a sea creature, for example, the Games Master should feel free to penalize by at least one Difficulty Grade, the use of any skills that would take time to learn while adjusting to the new form until there has been sufficient time to practice. This is especially true of physical skills such as Athletics, Unarmed, Swim, Fly, Combat Skills, and so on.

The Willpower roll to retain one's personality is required every day that the subject remains transformed until failed, causing the person to finally succumb to the mentality of the new form, with INT changing to INS in the case of a non-sapient creature. All special and magical Abilities owned by the new form that were not acquired previously, such as gaze attacks, breath weapons, and so on, are now available to the creature as the transformation is complete. Characters that lose their identity in this way become Non-Player Characters under the control of the Games Master.

Prior to succumbing mentally to the transformation, the polymorphed creature is susceptible to Dispel Magic as normal, with no roll to resist required, as it would be one's subconscious desire to return to normal. The transformation does require another Willpower roll to resist the strain, with a Failure stunning the subject for 1d10 minutes, and a Fumble resulting in death from mental shock.

If the victim had previously succumbed to the new form, Dispel Magic may still be used; however, the victim will attempt to resist returning to the natural form with a Willpower roll. Failing this roll means the victim transforms back into the natural form, which, of course, requires another Willpower roll to resist the mental shock from the transformation. Once lost, a victim's natural identity is no longer attainable, instead the victim assumes the strange and alien form is not natural and yearns to be returned to its prior 'normal.' _For example, an orc that was polymorphed into a rabbit and assumed the creature's identity would believe that it is now a rabbit that has been rather rudely transformed into an orc._ Only a Wish, or other similar magic, has any chance of restoring the victim's identity once it has been lost.

All worn and carried equipment magically melds into the new form; however, in some cases, the Games Master may allow magic items that would still be able to be used in the creature's new form to remain, such as a magic ring or boots. Note this requires the creature's new SIZ to not be vastly different from the original. There is a POW x1% chance for each worn magic item of a defensive or miscellaneous nature, subject to Games Master approval, to transfer its effects to the creature's new form. A creature with a +1 ring of protection for example, could gain a +1 bonus to its natural Armor Points. Creatures with the natural capability to shape change, such as doppelgängers and lycanthropes, will be transformed as normal, but may assume their normal form after 1 Round. If slain, a polymorphed creature reverts to its natural form, even if it has previously lost all traces of identity.

| 3 | 5, +1 EXP | 45-foot Range; 11-15 SIZ points of difference |

#### Polymorph Self

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 20 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** NA |

The caster can assume the form of any other corporeal creature, from as small as SIZ 1 up to SIZ 40. Each point of Intensity allows an increase or decrease of up to 10 points of SIZ. Therefore, a magic-user of SIZ 13 could assume the shape of a SIZ 34 grizzly bear at 3 levels of Intensity. The transformation process takes a full Round and grants the caster the assumed creature's form of breathing (if other than that of itself, for example, breathing water), any natural attacks, Hit Points, Damage Modifier, and its normal mode of movement. It does not grant any heightened or magical Abilities possessed by the creature. A magic-user that has polymorphed into a hawk, for example, will not gain the bird's extraordinary eyesight. The caster gains the creature's physical skills such as Athletics, Brawn, Fly, Swim, and so forth, but retains any mental and social skills (those requiring INT and CHA). The caster loses the capacity to speak unless the creature in question possesses the ability to articulate words. If so, the caster can still cast spells in the new form assuming the caster can form a spell's somatic components.

The caster may end the effect at any time, and in the process, all Minor Wounds gained while in the new form are lost, and Serious Wounds are reduced to Minor Wounds (half Hit Points lost in each applicable location). Major Wounds are not affected by the transformation and carry over to the natural form. There is no healing when the caster transforms from natural to animal form.

Polymorph is subject to Dispel Magic. In this case, the caster does not benefit from the healing. If slain, the caster will revert to the natural form. If transformed into a flier and required to make a Fly skill roll, Athletics or Acrobatics may be substituted at two grades of difficulty. However, a character that uses this form frequently may choose to develop the Fly skill normally at a Base Value of STR+DEX.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |

#### Power Word - Blind

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 15 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Endurance |

Upon successfully casting this spell, one creature of the caster's choice within both line of sight and Range, is struck blind, along with all others in a 15 ft. radius that fail a Resistance roll. This blindness may be cured by the casting of Cure Blindness or Dispel Magic. The spell's Duration is modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result. This is detailed in the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Duration** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 1d4+1 x10 minutes\*\* |

_\*\* If only one to three creatures are in the Area of Effect, the effects are permanent until magically treated._

#### Power Word - Kill

(Conjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity, +3 EXP | **Range:** 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 10 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Endurance |

The successful casting of this spell will kill either a single creature of up to Rank 3 or SIZ 60 (or 4 creatures per Intensity of no greater than SIZ 20), that fail a Resistance roll. This spell is extremely draining on the caster, with each casting causing the automatic loss of one level of Fatigue. All potential targets must lie within the Area of Effect, as designated when the spell is cast. The Intensity required is dependent upon the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the target the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Intensity** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 1 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 2 | 21-40 | 2 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 3 | 41-60 | 3 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 4-5 | 61+ | No effect |

_\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class._

Creatures larger than SIZ 60 are unaffected, as are characters of Rank 4 and up. Unlike the Death Spell, Power Word - Kill will kill anything within the above-mentioned limits, however, it is possible to bring victims back to life through the casting of Wish, Raise Dead, Resurrection, and Reincarnation as normal.

#### Power Word – Stun

| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Endurance |

Upon successfully casting this spell, one creature of the caster's choice within both line of sight and Range, which fails a Resistance roll is stunned. The victim is rendered briefly insensible, only allowed Reactive Actions of a defensive nature. The Duration is modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result for the target. This is detailed on the following table. This stunning may be cured before the Duration expires through the casting of Dispel Magic.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Duration** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 4d4 Rounds |
| 2 | 21-40 | 2d4 Rounds |

| **Sphere:** Combat | **Duration:** 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 60 ft. Radius | **Resist:** NA |

When cast, this spell blesses the cleric and all allies within the Area of Effect, while cursing those in opposition. Allies are granted a temporary +5% bonus to all skill and Resistance rolls along with a +1 bonus to all damage dealt, while enemies receive a -5% penalty and -1 damage reduction. This spell may be cast along with Chant if cast by either the same cleric, or another cleric of the same religion, allowing both effects to stack, granting a +10% bonus to skills and +2 to damage, while enemies receive the opposite.

| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 5 mi. Radius | **Resist:** NA |

#### Preserve

(Transmutation)

| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Animal, Plant | **Duration:** 1d3 Months |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** NA |

Preserve prevents organic matter, both vegetable and animal, from bacterial decay and putrefaction for 1d3 months, by sterilizing it. If the material is later smoked, pickled, or salted it is preserved indefinitely. The spell can halt decay that has begun, but not reverse it. The caster can affect an amount of organic matter equal in 'Things' or SIZ to their POW.

#### Protection

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 0, Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** Trigger |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

Protection is useful in a wide range of tasks where there is a risk of accidental injury such as working in a foundry or mine. The first time the character would normally take damage that penetrates protective clothing or armor, the Protection spell will trigger, and reduce the damage taken by 1d3 points. The spell then dissipates. This spell stacks with all other forms of protection magic. The spell only protects against physical damage so will not help against events such as fire, choking, and so on. The mage version of this spell may be cast on themselves only.

#### Protection from Cold

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration:** 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from all forms of natural cold. When cast on oneself, the field also offers complete protection from cold-based damage (white dragon breath, cone of cold, chill metal, and so on), absorbing 12 points of cold damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, complete protection from natural cold is also granted. In addition, damage from magical cold attacks is reduced by half.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 15 min.; 12 points of cold protection on self |
| 2 | 4 | 30 min.; 24 points of cold protection on self |

#### Protection from Evil \(R\)

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1, Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Protection | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When cast, an invisible aura of magical armor radiates from the recipient of the spell (which can be the caster), granting three different levels of defense.

First, attacks by creatures with an Evil Alignment receive a -10% penalty to their Combat Style or Unarmed skill. Resistance rolls on the part of the recipient of Protection from Evil receive a +10% bonus, but only against evil creatures.

Second, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor beings not native to the material plane, may make physical contact with the recipient. This includes demons, devils, genies, elementals, aerial servants, salamanders, and so on. Natural attacks by these creatures cause them to recoil, thus failing to make contact. This also includes any monsters or creatures conjured or summoned by spells or items. Weapons held by such creatures may still enter the magical barrier and strike the protected individual, however.

Third, any attempts of mental control (such as by spells like Charm or Command) or possession (such as by spells like Magic Jar), automatically fail to penetrate the magical protection.

The spell's Duration ends if the protected individual makes any type of melee attack or attempts to impose the protective field against an affected creature.

The reverse of this spell, Protection from Good, works as above with regards to the second and third benefit, while the first benefit functions as noted with regards to good opponents.

#### Protection from Fire

(Abjuration)

| **Sphere:** Protection, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration:** 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from all forms of mundane sources of heat, such as torches, campfires, burning buildings, and so forth. When cast on oneself, the field also offers complete protection from fire-based damage (red dragon breath, Burning Hands, Heat Metal, and so on), absorbing 12 points of fire damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, complete protection from mundane fire is also granted. In addition, damage from magical fire attacks is reduced by half.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |

| **Sphere:** Protection, Weather | **Duration:** 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from electrical based damage (blue dragon breath, shocking grasp, electrical traps, and so on), absorbing 12 points of electrical damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, damage from electrical attacks is reduced by half.

#### Purify Food and Drink \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** All | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft. |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, all poison, rot, and other contaminants are removed from an average sized meal of food and/or water per Intensity within the spell's Area of Effect. The purifying properties of this spell also destroy the malignant properties of unholy water.

The reverse of the spell, Contaminate Food and Drink, spoils food, makes pure water undrinkable, and corrupts the sacred properties of holy water.

---
#### Raise Dead \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Necromantic | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity, +1 EXP | **Range:** 100 ft. |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA (Willpower) |

This spell may be cast on the corpse of a creature dead less than 24 hours per level of Intensity. If the subject's Alignment was anything other than evil, they can resist the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll and, if successful, negate the effects of the spell. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to return to the living once it has reached its eternal reward. The Games Master can decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live.

In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return to the material plane instead of suffering eternal damnation, it is not the deceased's Willpower that is resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so on, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, the more powerful the being placed in charge of their damnation. If the caster succeeds, they have successfully returned the spirit to the body, while a failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

If the casting is successful, the subject is returned to life with full Hit Points, although severed limbs remain lost. This means that a victim decapitated or cut in half cannot be raised until their head or torso is first reattached. This can be done before the casting of Raise Dead by physically reattaching the severed location, which requires a healer's kit and a successful application of the Healing skill, and typically leaves an obvious and telling scar. Other maladies, such as poison or disease must be taken care of prior to, or after the casting of Raise Dead, or the results are only temporary. Finally, Raise Dead has no effect on a creature that has reached the end of its natural life span, and died of old age.

The act of being raised from the dead is very straining on the subject, who is reduced to a Fatigue Level of Incapacitated for a period of 24 hours for each day they were dead. The casting of Cure Fatigue has no effect on the patient during this time of convalescence. After this point, the character recovers from Fatigue normally, and without restriction.

When reversed, Slay Living, can be used to kill one victim designated by the cleric at the time of the casting. This victim is allowed a Willpower roll to resist, modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result to the target, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Willpower Modifier** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Hard |
| 2 | 21-40 | Standard |
| 3 | 41-60 | Easy |
| 4-5 | 61+ | Very Easy |

_\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class._

If the Resistance roll is unsuccessful, the victim is slain outright. A successful roll is treated as per the effects of Cause Serious Wounds. Armor offers no protection from this damage.

#### Read Magic

(All)

| **Rank:** Mage 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** NA |

This spell is the first spell taught to apprentice magic-users, for it is through this spell that they can read the magical writings of another spellcaster. Mages' own magical writings are always intelligible to themselves. Reading magical script does not typically activate a contained spell such as that found on magical scrolls, for example; however, cursed magic scrolls and the like are activated by using this spell, casting whatever spell the scroll contained.

When used to identify a spell contained on a scroll or within a spell book, 1 minute is required for each spell Rank; Rank 1 spells take 1 minute, Rank 2 spells take 2 minutes, and so forth. If sufficient Duration remains, additional spells may be identified during this time. Once this spell has been used to read and identify a set of magical inscriptions, the magic-user does not need to cast Read Magic to read them again; however, the same spell on a separate scroll, book, and so on, would need another casting of Read Magic.

Read Magic is usable by all Schools of Magic.

#### Regenerate \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 3 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Creature | **Resist:** NA (Parry or Evade) |

When cast, the cleric may touch one creature and regenerate a dismembered Hit Location. Lost limbs will completely grow back at a rate of 1 Hit Point every 10 minutes until fully healed. However, if the severed location is present and touching the victim, the entire recovery time is reduced to 1 minute. This spell cannot be used to 'clone' an individual by regenerating two separate parts, with only the portion connected to the brain and central nervous system benefiting from the effects of the spell. Each level of Intensity will regrow a separate Hit Location. While the spell could be used to slowly heal a lesser injury, there are lower Rank, less costly spells to do so.

When reversed, Wither will cause a location touched by the caster to shrivel up and eventually fall off the victim. The process causes the loss of 1 Hit Point of damage to the impacted location per 10 minutes, with the location becoming unusable at 0 Hit Points, and falling off when fully negative. The effects may only be negated by a casting of Regenerate.

#### Reincarnation, Arcane

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity, +1EXP | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** See Below |

This spell is cast while touching the corpse of a creature dead less than 24 hours per level of Intensity. However, this version of Reincarnation has no effect on full-blooded elves (instead, see the divine spells [Raiae Dead](0010_Spells.md?id=raise-dead-r) or [Resurrection](0010_Spells.md?id=resurrection-r)). If the victim's Alignment was anything other than evil, the victim resists the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll, and if successful, negates the effects of the spell. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to enter a new body once it has reached its eternal reward. The Games Master can decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live.

#### Reincarnation, Arcane

_The original rule was as follows: "However, this version of Reincarnation has no effect on full-blooded elves (instead, see Divine Reincarnation)."_

_There is no mention of Divine Reincarnation in Classic Fantasy Imperative so this has been changed to reference Raise Dead and Resurrection, neither of which prohibit elvish returns._

---

</details>

In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return to the material plane instead of suffering eternal damnation, it is not the deceased's Willpower that's resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so forth, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, the more powerful the being placed in charge of his or her damnation. If the caster succeeds, they have successfully anchored the spirit to the host, while a failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

If the casting is successful, a fully formed adult body appears in 1d6x10 minutes containing the consciousness of the deceased. The caster has no control of the form or sex in which the soul returns - roll against the table below. The former character Class and Rank is retained. This means it may take some convincing on the part of the character that they are who they say they are when dealing with friends, family, and former acquaintances; this includes their order or guild when it comes time for Advancement if relevant. This is best represented by Influence rolls on the part of the character, modified by how drastic the change is, as determined by the Games Master. For example, a dwarf reincarnated into another dwarf may require a Standard Influence roll to convince a former ally of their actual identity, while being reincarnated into a gnome or halfling could result in the roll being one grade more difficult. Finally, that same character could find it two grades more difficult convincing others of their identity if changed into something as extreme as a goblin, orc, or troll.

All Characteristics are determined randomly as per the new form, apart from INT, POW, and CHA, which remain unchanged. Recalculate the character's Base skill levels and adjust the skill totals accordingly. Passions are unaffected. Any former racial Abilities are lost and replaced with those of the new species. If the new form is unsuited to the old character Class, the only option is to deal with it, or learn a new Class. The reincarnated individual remembers most of their former life, though the Games Master may ask for the character to make a Willpower roll to remember significant facts for the first week. A Wish can return the reincarnated individual back to their previous form if later desired.

Roll on the following table to determine the new form.

#### Remove Curse \(R\)

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** ?? | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

This spell typically removes the effects of any curse afflicting a creature or item. It does not remove the cursed nature of an item such as a weapon, shield, or armor, but does allow a creature afflicted with such an item to be rid of it. Some curses may only be removed if the spell is cast at a certain Intensity, typically noted in the specific write-up. Either Cure Disease or Remove Curse may be used to cure lycanthropy, with either requiring an Intensity of 12.

The reverse of this spell, Bestow Curse, inflicts one of the following effects on an enemy with a Duration of 30 minutes per Intensity. The victim is allowed an Opposed Willpower roll to resist as normal. Roll 1d100 to determine the nature of the curse inflicted:

- 01-25: All skills using STR, DEX, or CON are one grade more difficult. Initiative -4, Damage Modifier reduced 2 steps.
- 26-50: All skills using INT, POW, or CHA are one grade more difficult. Initiative -4.
- 51-75: Combat Skills and Resistance rolls are 2 grades more difficult.
- 76-00: All failed skill rolls are treated as Fumbles.

#### Remove Fear \(R\)

(Abjuration (Charm))

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Charm | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** See Below |

The caster of this spell may banish the effects of fear from one individual per Intensity, granting them an additional roll to resist. Remove Fear may also divinely ward against fear for 10 minutes when cast on someone not yet suffering its effects. In both cases, the Resistance roll required of the subject is one grade easier. While the cleric could cast this spell on themselves to ward against fear, they would not be able to cast it to remove any ongoing effects of fear that would prevent the casting of spells.

The reverse of this spell, Cause Fear, requires touching the victim in combat. Those that fail a Willpower Resistance roll flee in terror at a Sprint for 1d4 Rounds. The direction must be away from the caster of the spell. Cause Fear may be countered by Remove Fear and vice versa.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 30 ft. Range; 1 subject |
| 2 | 2 | 60 ft. Range; 2 subjects |

#### Repair

| **Sphere:** ?? | **Duration:** 24 Hours |

Repair fixes physical damage to an inanimate object. Each separate successful casting repairs 1d3 Hit Points of damage.

#### Resurrection \(R\)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5 | **Casting Time:** 10 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Necromantic | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity, +2 EXP | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA (Willpower (Formidable)) |

Resurrection raises any creature dead for no more than 20 years per level of Intensity. The creature is not only given life, but restored to full strength and healed from injury, even restoring lost limbs. Little of the actual creature needs to remain for the spell to still be effective. For example, Resurrection could be used to bring a being back from the dead after 145 years, even if possessing nothing more than a finger bone, assuming the spell is cast at 8 Intensity. The raised individual requires no period of rest and is fully functional immediately. The spell has no effect on a creature that died of natural causes at the end of its allotted lifespan.

If the subject's Alignment was anything other than evil, they can resist the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll and, if successful, negate the effects. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to return to the living once it has reached its eternal reward. However, the Games Master may decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live. In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return instead of suffering eternal damnation, it isn't the deceased's Willpower that's resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so forth, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, the more powerful the being placed in charge of his or her damnation. If the caster succeeds, the subject has been successfully resurrected, while a failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

Resurrection is very draining, Aging the cleric 3% of their typical lifespan (3 years in the case of a human caster). See the rules for [Aging](0007_Game_System.md?id=aging).

When reversed, Destruction, may be used to kill one victim in contact with the cleric at the time of the casting. This victim is allowed a Willpower roll to resist, modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the victim the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Willpower Modifier** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Formidable |
| 2 | 21-40 | Hard |
| 3 | 41-60 | Standard |
| 4 | 61-80 | Easy |
| 5 | 81+ | Very Easy |

_\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class._

If this Resistance roll is unsuccessful, the subject is slain outright, their body being turned to dust. Only the casting of Wish will bring the victim back at this stage. On a successful roll, the subject is still reduced to negative 1d4 Hit Points in the touched Hit Location. Armor offers no protection from this damage. Destruction does not age the caster when used.

#### Restoration

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3 | **Casting Time:** 3 Minutes |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** Permanent |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

When cast, a victim previously drained of their life force using Energy Drain or similar effects regains one previously lost level of Fatigue. At 1 level of Intensity, this spell only works on a creature drained within the last 24 Hours. Each additional Intensity increases the time that can have passed by a further 24 Hours. For example, a victim previously drained just under 48 hours ago would need the spell cast at 2 Intensity to work. Multiple levels of drained Fatigue require additional castings of Restoration. Regardless of Duration and in addition to any Fatigue restored, this spell also restores all mental capacities, such as those lost through magic or any form of insanity or dementia. Restoration may also be used to remove years lost due to artificial aging, such as that from certain spells. For the spell to be cast in this way, in addition to the normal casting cost, the cleric must expend 1 EXP Roll for each 1% of the recipient's typical lifespan to be restored (1 year for a human). The spell may not reduce the subject's current age below that of their actual age.

#### Secure Portal

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 1 Portal | **Resist:** NA |

This spell may be cast to hold shut one door, portcullis, gate, or other similar aperture of wood, stone, or metal as if securely locked. The door, which may be up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, may be battered down but will not otherwise open for the Duration of the spell, which may be ended by the caster at any time. The spell may be negated with the successful casting of Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude or Knock at any Intensity. Secure Portal is also automatically bypassed by creatures from beyond the prime material plane such as demons, devils, angels, and elementals since they can pass through solid material. This will also not affect Blink or other such spells.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 min.; 60-foot Range; up to 25 hp portal; a typical wooden door |
| 2 | 2 | 2 min.; 120-foot Range; up to 50 hp portal; a wooden reinforced door |
| 3 | 3 | 3 min.; 180-foot Range; up to 75 hp portal; an iron door or portcullis |
| 4 | 4 | 4 min.; 240-foot Range; up to 120 hp portal; a small castle gate |
| 5 | 5 | 5 min.; 300-foot Range; up to 150 hp portal; a large, reinforced castle gate |

#### Shield

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 5 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** Caster | **Resist:** NA |

Shield creates an invisible mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the magic-user, increasing the difficulty of attacks striking from that direction by deflecting them away. In miniatures combat, Shield will only block damage that passes through one of the caster's front squares. The magic-user does not have to make any kind of skill test beyond the casting of the spell, as the spell's magic automatically interposes the shield between the attacks and the caster. The penalty applied to attacks that strike through the caster's front facing, is based on the attack type, and detailed in the following table.

| **Type of Attack** | **Examples** | **Difficulty to Strike Caster** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| Magic missile | Magic Missiles only | Impossible, Magic Missiles are automatically blocked |
| Hurled attacks | Rocks, thrown axes and spears, and so forth | Herculean |
| Device propelled attacks | Arrows, crossbow and manticore bolts, sling stones and bullets, and so forth | Formidable |
| Other physical | Swords, bites, claws, and so on | Hard |
| Spells that may be Evaded | Fire ball, lightning bolt, cone of cold, and so on | Normal difficulty, but no damage if caster evades and half if they fail |

#### Silence

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Guardian | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 360 ft |
| **Area:** 15 ft. Radius | **Resist:** See Below |

This spell allows the caster to create complete and utter silence in the Area of Effect. No sound whatsoever is possible, conversations cease, spells with a verbal component cannot be cast, and so forth. If Silence is cast on an object or creature, the spell's Area of Effect will move along with the target. However, the same spell cast into open air will remain immobile. The spell's Duration depends on whether the subject is willing or unwilling. On a willing target, the Duration is 2 Minutes/Intensity, while an on unwilling target the Duration is 2 Rounds/Intensity. A Willpower Resistance roll is allowed only if the spell is cast on an unwilling creature and if successful, the spell instead targets the area the creature occupies, remaining immobile.

#### Sleep

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 60 ft |
| **Area:** 10 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell causes a magical slumber to fall upon one living creature per level of Intensity in a circular area 10 feet in radius. The spell's Area of Effect is centered at a point in space or on the ground and the closest creature can resist first, then the next closest, and so forth. Where two or more fall at equal distance, randomly determine who is affected. Each creature is allowed a roll to resist and if one is successful, another must try until a total have been affected equal to the spell's Intensity, or no more creatures occupy the Area of Effect. Creatures in a heightened state of alertness, or in combat when the spell is cast, find the roll to resist one grade easier.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to Sleep, with the resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. Smaller creatures are always affected before larger ones; therefore, creatures of SIZ 20 or less are always affected before those of SIZ 21 to 40, which are themselves always affected before those of SIZ 41+.

While sleeping, affected creatures are helpless and normal noise will not faze them, but they can be shaken or slapped awake. Any attack, assuming it is not fatal, will also cause them to awaken (though the attack will come as a Surprise). Attempting to awaken a creature takes 1 Combat Round.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 5 min. Duration; 1 creature |
| 2 | 4 | 10 min. Duration; 2 creatures |
| 3 | 5 | 15 min. Duration; 3 creatures |
| 4 | 6 | 20 min. Duration; 4 creatures |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Slow

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to halve the normal Movement Rate of one creature. An additional creature may be slowed for each additional level of Intensity. Those affected must be within the Area of Effect when the spell is first cast but may move freely thereafter. In addition, those under the effects of Slow receive a -4 penalty to their Initiative for the spell's Duration and must reduce their total Action Points by half, including any used for Reactive purposes only. The casting of Slow cancels out the effects of Haste. Slow does not stack with itself or similar magical effects.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 2 Round Duration; 1 creature |
| 2 | 6 | 4 Round Duration; 2 creatures |
| 3 | 9 | 6 Round Duration; 3 creatures |
| 4 | 12 | 8 Round Duration; 4 creatures |
| +1 | +3 | Continue progression |

#### Slow Poison

(Necromancy)

| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Healing | **Duration:** 1 Hour/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

This spell allows the caster to slow the effects of poisons and venom; it does not, however, neutralize the toxin. Instead, the toxins spreading through the body are slowed enough that hopefully additional curative measures can be found. A toxin's Onset Time does not kick in until after the spell's Duration has expired.

For example, cobra venom possesses an Onset Time as follows: agony after 1d6+4 minutes, and Asphyxiation after 1d6+6 hours. A single Intensity of Slow Poison therefore postpones the Onset Time by 1 hour, after which, 1d6+4 minutes later, agony sets in as normal.

If Slow Poison is cast on a victim after symptoms have set in, they cease until after the spell's Duration expires and then continue as normal.

As a last resort, if the caster can get to an individual that has 'died' of poisoning within 10 minutes, Slow Poison delays the death of a victim for 1 hour per Intensity, during which the victim remains in a coma. If during this time, the victim can be cured of the poison the victim may yet live and be revived by First Aid or magical healing.

#### Speak with Monsters

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 100 ft |
| **Area:** 1 or more Monsters | **Resist:** NA |

This spell allows the caster to understand and be understood by any type of creature capable of any form of communication (telepathic, pheromones, tactile, and so on). The caster simply speaks in their own language and the creature understands the caster's intent or query in its own form of communication. The Games Master should determine the creature's reaction based on its Alignment as compared with that of the caster. The caster may switch from one creature to another of the same type throughout the spell's Duration.

#### Sphere of Invulnerability, Lesser

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, an immobile sphere of shimmering magical protection forms around the caster. Rank 1 and 2 spells, as well as any magical areas of effect they produce, will fail to penetrate the sphere, including those possessed by magical items or the innate magical Abilities of some creatures. The caster and any spell-capable allies may launch a magical attack from within the sphere with no adverse effects, and even leave the sphere and return without affecting its Duration. Lesser Sphere of Invulnerability is affected normally by Dispel Magic.

---
#### Spider Climb

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

The subject of this spell can move along vertical surfaces and ceilings with a 10-foot Movement Rate, even while hanging upside down. The subject must remove all hand and footwear and using objects of negligible ENC (ENC less than 1) is impossible due to them sticking to their hands. This includes most spell-casting material components, typically making spell casting impossible while under the influence of Spider Climb. To pull an object free from the individual or pull a resisting individual free from a surface requires a successful Brawn roll at Formidable difficulty.

#### Spiritshield

(Abjuration)

| **Rank:** Cleric 0 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Necromantic | **Duration:** Concentration |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** Willpower |

This spell creates a shield around the recipient that deters spirits and ghosts from entering. Any spirit or ghost wishing to attack or possess the recipient must overcome the spell by winning an Opposed Test of their Willpower vs. the caster's Piety skill.

#### Spiritual Hammer

(Invocation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Combat | **Duration:** 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 30 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist:** Parry or Evade |

Upon casting this spell, a hammer-like force of spiritual energy appears, which then hurls itself at a target designated by the caster. Each Turn, the caster may use one of their Action Points to direct the hammer to attack, provided Concentration is maintained. While concentrating, the caster is limited to moving no faster than a walk, and may Evade or Parry with an equipped weapon or shield without breaking concentrating. With each Action Point spent to manipulate the hammer, it can be moved to any location within the caster's field of vision. If the caster is behind an opponent, they may use the hammer to strike the opponent from behind, negating their chance to defend themselves to the best of their ability. Spiritual Hammer causes damage as a normal war hammer (1d8+1), and has a chance to hit equal to the cleric's Combat Skill. Worn armor offers only half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. It may be parried or evaded as normal and attacks against it are ineffective. Spiritual Hammer counts as a magical weapon with regards to striking creatures only harmed by magic, with every 2 levels of Intensity after the first granting the equivalent of a cumulative +1 Magic Bonus, to a Maximum of +5. This bonus does not add to the damage inflicted, rather, it helps damage creatures only harmed by a certain magic bonus or higher.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 Rounds; 30 ft. radius; counts as +0 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 Rounds; 60 ft. radius; counts as +1 |
| 3 | 5 | 9 Rounds; 90 ft. radius; counts as +2 |
| 4 | 6 | 12 Rounds; 120 ft. radius; counts as +3 |
| 5 | 7 | 15 Rounds; 150 ft. radius; counts as +4 |
| 6 | 8 | 18 Rounds; 180 ft. radius; counts as +5 max |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression for Rounds and radius |

#### Sun Ray

(Evocation, Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 5 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Sun | **Duration:** 1d4+1 Rounds |
| **Cost:** 3/Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 5 ft. Radius | **Resist:** See Below |

When cast, the cleric may summon a brilliant beam of holy light using a Cast Magic Action at any point during the spell's Duration. The beam is natural sunlight and has a five-foot radius. Those in the Area of Effect must Evade to attempt to shield their eyes or become blinded for 1d3 Minutes. If they fail their Resistance roll, the Sun Ray blinds creatures using Dark Vision for 2d4 Minutes and they lose their Dark Vision capability for 1d4+1 Minutes out to 20 feet beyond the Area of Effect. Creatures that find natural sunlight harmful to their vision are blinded permanently on a failed Resistance roll or blinded for 2d6 Rounds if the roll is successful.

Undead in the Area of Effect take 2d6 points of damage to each Hit Location. Armor, natural or otherwise, offers no protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Those within five feet of the edge of the Area of Effect may Evade to take no damage. Undead within 20 feet of the Area of Effect still take 1d6+1 points of damage but suffer no damage on a successful Resistance roll. Undead specifically harmed by sunlight, such as vampires, are destroyed if they fail to Evade. Fungoid creatures as well as all forms of subterranean fungi suffer the same effects as undead but cannot make a Resistance roll.

#### Tidy

| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1 | **Range:** 20 ft |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** NA |

Tidy immediately restores a number of items (up to the caster's POW) equal in size to no more than 2 'Things' each, to a neat, tidy, and orderly fashion within the spell's Range. Items larger than 2 'Things' each are shifted to a more orderly position but will require manual intervention to tidy properly.

#### True Seeing

(Divination)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3, Mage 4 | **Casting Time:** 1 Round |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Divination | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 Target | **Resist:** NA |

True Seeing grants the subject the capacity to see the world clearly, to a Range of 60 feet, subject to line of sight. All secrets within the Area of Effect become apparent; both natural and magical darkness is penetrated; secret doors become visible; invisible or ethereal attackers are revealed; illusions and phantasms become obvious; and the true form of shape-changed creatures is revealed. Even the ethereal and other planes adjacent to the material plane can be glimpsed with Concentration. True Seeing also negates the effects of spells such as Blur and Mirror Image. In addition to mundane material components, casting True Seeing requires rare ingredients made from powdered mushrooms, saffron, and animal fat, with a value of at least 300GP.

Voice amplifies the recipient's intonation and delivery so that it becomes compelling when issuing verbal commands. All who can hear the speaker are forced to listen. Their vocalization also carries across and through even the loudest background noise (howling gales, the roar of a waterfall, the clash of arms on a battlefield) up to a Range of 30 times the recipient's CHA in feet.

#### Wall of Fire/Circle of Fire

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 3, Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** ?? | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** See Below |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** See Below |

This spell allows the caster to conjure forth a wall or circle of blazing flame, as desired at the time of casting, burning a purple or a reddish blue in color. The spell's Duration remains in effect if Concentration is maintained, or for 1 Round per Intensity once Concentration ceases. The specifics are detailed below according to type:

**Wall of Fire:** This version of the spell creates a stationary wall of fire 20 ft. long per Intensity. Regardless of final Intensity the wall has a height of 10 to 20 ft. as desired when cast. Wall of Fire has a Range of 180 ft. and may not be conjured horizontally.

**Circle of Fire:** This version of the spell creates a circle of fire around the caster that moves with them. It has a radius of 10 ft., plus another 5 ft. per additional Intensity beyond the first. Regardless of final Intensity the circle has a height of 10 to 20 ft. as desired when cast. Circle of Fire must encircle the caster and has a Range of 0.

The side of the wall or circle facing away from the caster emits scorching heat, causing 1d6 damage per Round to all within 10 ft., and 1d4 damage out to 20 ft. This damage is typically applied at the end of the Round before proceeding to the next. Where a victim occupies both heat zones in a single Round, the greater damage applies. Those leaping through the flame are subjected to 2d6 points of damage, plus an additional point of damage per Intensity beyond the first. This damage is applied to each Hit Location and worn armor offers no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. A successful Evade Resistance roll allows the victim to suffer no damage on the Round the spell springs into being, as the victim attempts to dive away from the heat or past the flames. Fire-using creatures take half this damage and cold-using creatures double. The flames have a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See the section on [Fires](0007_Game_System.md?id=fire-based-attacks) for additional information.

#### Water Breathing \(R\)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 2, Mage 2 | **Casting Time:** 2 Actions |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Elemental (Water, Air) | **Duration:** 6 hours/Intensity, +1d4 Hours |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** Touch |
| **Area:** 1 or more Targets | **Resist:** NA |

This spell imparts the ability for the caster or others to breathe water throughout its Duration. While being cast, more than one recipient may be touched and therefore gain the benefits of Water Breathing. In this case, the Duration is divided by the number of subjects. The exact Duration of the Water Breathing spell is unpredictable, and should be rolled by the Games Master, as those under its effects should not know specifically how much time is left. The reverse of this spell, Air Breathing, allows a creature otherwise unable to breathe oxygen to do so. The capability to breathe one's natural element is still retained regardless of the variant of the spell, so a fish could both breathe on land and under the water during the Duration of the spell.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 6 hours +1d4 hours total |
| 2 | 4 | 12 hours +1d4 hours total |
| 3 | 5 | 18 hours +1d4 hours total |
| 4 | 6 | 24 hours +1d4 hours total |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Web

(Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 20 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area:** 20 ft. Radius | **Resist:** Evade, plus See Below |

This spell causes long strands of sticky webbing to shoot from the caster's hand, which may be anchored floor to ceiling, or wall to wall, to block a passage or impede progress. It may also be sprayed directly onto opponents to entangle them.

Assuming the target has room to escape the webs, a successful Evade roll places the target outside the Area of Effect; however, this requires an Action Point to be available. A failed resistance roll leaves the victim immobilized, and 1d3 Hit Locations entangled. Like the [Entangle](https://cfi-srd.mythras.net/#/0008_Combat?id=entangle) Special Effect, a webbed location is unusable. An entangled arm cannot use whatever it is holding, a snared chest, abdomen, or leg makes all physical skill rolls one grade harder (Except Brawn rolls used to try to break free), and an enmeshed head causes suffocation as detailed under [Asphyxiation](0007_Game_System.md?id=asphyxiation).

On the following Turn, the victim may spend an Action Point to attempt to break free of the webbing. Magic webbing is incredibly strong and sticky, possessing 6 Armor Points and Hit Points equal to 3x the spell's Intensity. Attempting to break free requires the victim to win an Opposed Roll of Brawn against the web's Stickiness (equal to the caster's Arcane Casting skill). If this fails, the target remains fastened, unable to break free by strength alone. Attempting to cut free exposes the tool or weapon used to the same process. Despite popular belief, webs are not flammable, but a character might slowly burn a way through a web by using a flame to shrivel the strands (fire damage ignores the Web's Armor Points).

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 1 | 3 | 20 min.; 30-foot Range; 6 armor, 3 Hit Points |
| 2 | 4 | 40 min.; 60-foot Range; 6 armor, 6 Hit Points |
| 3 | 5 | 60 min.; 90-foot Range; 6 armor, 9 Hit Points |
| 4 | 6 | 80 min.; 120-foot Range; 6 armor, 12 Hit Points |
| +1 | +1 | Continue progression |

#### Wish

(Conjuration, Evocation)

| **Rank:** Mage 5 | **Casting Time:** See Below |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1 or more EXP | **Range:** Unlimited |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** See Below |

Wish can change reality in a permanent and significant way. To cast this spell, the magic-user must spend 3 Magic Points and 1 or more EXP rolls depending on the desired results. Each successive casting of Wish in a 1-Month span doubles the expenditure of EXP required normally. The Casting Time is typically required to verbally detail the specifics of the Wish. Upon completion, the caster suffers a loss of Fatigue equal to the EXP expended and ages 5% of their normal life expectancy (for humans, that would be five years). See [Aging](0007_Game_System.md?id=aging) for the average life expectancies of the demi-human races.

The results of a Wish should be taken literally and are open to interpretation by the Games Master. Greedy desires typically end badly. There is a 10% chance that a Wish made with greedy intentions backfires in some way. For example, wishing for wealth could teleport it from the treasure vaults of the local lord or king. A Wish cannot cancel decrees of deity-like entities unless such a being issued said Wish.

Some example Wishes and the required EXP expenditure follow.

_\*\* Each successive increase or decrease costs 1 cumulative EXP Roll: 1 EXP for the first, 2 EXP for the second, 3 EXP for the third, 4 EXP for the fourth, and 5 EXP for the fifth. This applies even in the case of a different magic-user casting Wish._

_\*\*\* This requires a Willpower vs. Willpower Resistance roll against that of the intended victim. Failure means the Wish still succeeds, though as a twisted interpretation of the wisher's desires. For example, the caster could be transported to the future where the victim is already dead, but so are all the wisher's friends and loved ones._

#### Wizard Sight

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Mage 3 | **Casting Time:** 1 Minute |

| **Sphere:** None | **Duration:** 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost:** 1/Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** See Below | **Resist:** NA |

This spell creates a small invisible 'eye' that the magic-user may see through for the Duration of the spell. This eye may be moved ahead of the party or sent to look around corners and into rooms having a Movement Rate of 20 ft. per Round (240 ft. per minute), if only scanning for 'obvious' threats or items of interest. This will typically only extend to the floor and lower walls. If attempting to be more thorough (examining the full walls and ceiling as well), its Movement Rate is reduced to 10 ft. per Round (120 feet per minute). The Games Master should feel free to allow Perception rolls on the part of the caster, where necessary, with regards to spotting visual anomalies. The eye is corporeal, unable to pass through solid matter, and possesses normal vision out to 60 ft, and Infravision out to 10 ft. The caster must maintain Concentration on the eye throughout the Duration, or it will remain inert until Concentration is once again established. Any gaze attacks that would normally affect the caster still affect the caster as normal; however, the eye is considered independent of the caster with respect to blindness, darkness spells, and so forth. For the purposes of fitting through small openings, the eye is no bigger than 1 inch, and has a SIZ of 1.

#### Word of Recall

(Transmutation)

| **Rank:** Cleric 4 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Sphere:** Summoning | **Duration:** See Below |
| **Cost:** 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** The caster | **Resist:** NA |

When this spell is cast, the cleric is instantly teleported to a pre-designated sanctuary, and a designated arrival point no larger than 10-foot radii. There is no limit to the actual Range teleported, including between multiple planes. Within a single plane, there is no chance of a mishap, however, crossing even one plane gives a Fumble chance of 91-00%, two planes give a Fumble on a roll of 81-00%, and so on. This replaces the caster's normal Fumble chance. A Fumble when crossing planes signifies that the cleric is irrevocably lost. Fumbles within a single plane follow the normal rules.

In addition to themselves and any carried equipment, the cleric may transport another 3 objects per Intensity, each no bigger than SIZ/9 'Things'. The additional material transported may be treasure, equipment, or living beings. However, transported creatures must have the spell cast at a sufficient level of Intensity to cover any carried equipment.
