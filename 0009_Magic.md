# Cap√≠tulo 9: Magia

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses several default assumptions concerning the casting of magic. Since the same fundamental concepts are used by each discipline, these concepts have been collated here for easy reference and to avoid unnecessary duplication. The following rules are intended to be globally applied to all spellcasting.

---
## Magical Disciplines

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ provides rules for two magical types, called disciplines herein. Each magical discipline uses the same basic system detailed in this chapter with regards to how magic works and how characters come by it. The following chapter details the specific spells usable by each discipline, Arcane and Divine, respectively.

---
## Magical Energy

Although knowledge of magical powers may be prevalent in a setting, it does not automatically follow that the magical energy required to invoke them is as widespread, or even available. Having the skill to transform someone into a leopard is useless if you do not have the energy to cast the spell or request the miracle from the gods.

While every character has an Attribute known as Magic Points, derived from their Characteristic POW, this merely represents the capacity to hold or store magical energy, not necessarily the ability to generate their own.

#### Running Out of Magic Points

When Magic Points reach zero, no more spells or magical abilities that rely on them can be used.

#### Magic Points: Use & Recovery

In _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, characters generate their own magical energy, attracting and storing it from the world around them. This is the most common method of recovery and is simply a matter of resting and letting one's body absorb the natural magical emanations of the world or as part of a relationship with a god, until the points are restored. The magical character need do nothing else. This assumes complete rest, comfort, and freedom from threat or stress. Camping in an occupied dungeon or resting in the wilderness during the depths of winter would prevent or hinder recovery, whereas returning to somewhere safe and sheltered like an inn would permit it.

A full night's sleep replenishes all Magic Points, half in a place of danger or distraction. In addition, 1 Magic Point can be regained per 15 minutes of prayer or study of one's spell book during a [Short Rest](0007_Game_System.md?id=short-rests). Finally, Magic Points may be regained by quaffing a Potion of Magica as seen in the [Common Magic Items Table](0006_Money_and_Equipment.md?id=common-magic-items-table). Magic Points do not recover while active in any other way.

---
## Starting Spells

Each spell casting Class has its own formula for determining their starting spells. This can be found in their respective write-ups under Class Abilities.

---
##  Memorizing Spells

Just because a spellcaster knows a spell, does not mean they are ready to cast it. All spellcasters must commit spells to memory to have access to them when needed. The number of spells of their current Rank that a caster may have in memory is noted in the Rank Tables for each Class and found in their respective write-ups.

Memorizing a spell requires the caster to have first slept for at least 8 hours to have a clear mind. This sleep does not have to be continuous but must total at least 8 hours. The memorization process requires 15 minutes of calm study and concentration or prayer and devotion, regardless of Rank, as well as a calm, quiet area to concentrate. Regardless of Class, a caster that has already committed the maximum number of spells to memory must first forget one to memorize another. This requires 15 minutes per spell as above.

Mages must have access to their spell book to memorize a spell. A spell may not be memorized from another's spell book unless the desired spell is first deciphered by casting Read Magic. See Spell Books below.

When memorizing a Divine spell, the caster is assumed to be praying for their deity to grant them the ability to cast it. These spells may be drawn from any spells of the caster's Rank or below and placed into memory where they may be later cast. For example, a Rank 3 cleric may memorize any spell of Rank 3 or below.

---
## Learning New Spells

Each spell casting Class has its own system for learning new spells, detailed below.

### Learning New Arcane Spells

Learning Arcane spells requires extensive study and research, taking a significant period. However, the process may be considerably faster if the mage has access to another's spell book or a scroll. Each of the following procedures requires the mage to be of sufficient Rank to cast the spell in question.

#### Rank Increase

Arcane casters automatically learn three new spells whenever they gain a new Rank. This assumes the caster has been slowly researching the spells over time and they may be inscribed in their spell book following the normal procedure, however neither an Arcane Knowledge roll nor expenditure of Experience Rolls is required.

#### Through Research

To learn a new spell through research requires the investment of Experience Rolls equal in number to the spell's Rank. In addition, this research requires 1 week of study per spell Rank. For example, a Rank 2 spell would require 2 Experience Rolls and 2 weeks of study before the mage would be able to scribe it into their spell book. A character can break down the total investment of time and Experience Rolls into installments over several sessions of play. The mage is assumed to have been slowly scribing the spell into his spell book over the course of this research period. See The Scribing Process below for more information.

#### From Spell Books and Scrolls

Having access to a scroll or another's spell book allows the mage to copy the desired spell into a spell book of their own, or even add the complete spell book to their own collection. However, because of the endless variation in writing styles, notations, and ancient script, each spell requires a casting of Read Magic before the mage may commit the spell to memory or scribe it into their own spell book.

However, if the casting of Read Magic Fails, the character does not get a second chance to decipher this spell (from this source). They are only able to determine the spell's Rank and its name but fail to fully understand the secret formulas. An Arcane caster may automatically read the contents of their own spell book, and once a spell has been successfully deciphered, there is no need for the character to decipher it again.

Learning spells in this way does not require any Experience Rolls on the part of the character, as the actual research has already been done by the other party. It is possible to decipher a spell, only to then find out that it is of a Rank beyond the capability of the character at the current time.

#### Spell Books

Arcane spellcasters use spell books, sometimes called grimoires, to contain all their spell knowledge. These tomes are treasured by their owners, as a mage deprived of their spell book is limited to whatever spells they currently have in memory. While a beginning mage may require but a Cantole book, eventually they will need to expand their library, both to encompass their growing store of magic and to back up years of hard work and research. At these times, a mage may consider a traveling spell book containing some of their most used and common spells, while leaving much of their knowledge backed up safely at home.

When written into a spell book, Arcane spells use a system of ancient script, detailed notations, and magical formulas. All Arcane spellcasters use the same system regardless of native Idioma, culture, or species. However, each Arcane caster also inputs their own personal variations and nuances that make the writings incomprehensible to other spellcasters without the casting of Read Magic.

An Arcane caster may automatically read the contents of his own spell book and once a spell has been successfully deciphered with Read Magic, there is no need for the character to decipher it again.

### Learning New Divine Spells

Divine casters may memorize any spell they desire if they are of sufficient Rank. Therefore, a Divine caster learns all spells of a new Rank when they attain that Rank.

---
##  Spell Casting Requirements

All spellcasters are assumed to use ritual words and gestures to aid in the focuCanto of Concentration required for their proper incantation.

The caster must have previously memorized the spell to be cast and must have the requisite number of Magic Points remaining. Attempting to cast a spell with insufficient Magic Points means that the spell simply does not work.

By default, the following requirements are necessary for the casting of spells:

- The ability to gesture or symbolize with at least 1 free hand.
- The ability to make appropriate vocal sounds to invoke the spell.
- The ability to accurately perceive or sense a potential target if the spell has to be targeted.
- The possession of generic material spell components

Being denied even one of the above requirements renders a spellcaster unable to cast any spell unless otherwise noted.

On the last turn of casting, the caster must pass an Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling skill check. Failing to cast the spell correctly usually results in nothing negative, save that the magic does not work, or at worst forgetting the memorized spell as detailed below.

Casting a spell does not expunge it from the character's memory. The spell remains and may be continuously cast if sufficient Magic Points remain to do so. Typically, even being rendered unconscious will not cause the loss of a memorized spell. However, a character that has been killed and somehow returned to life can be expected to have forgotten their prepared spells, with the exception of necessitation through some powerful life-giving magic.

### Spell Components

In addition to both somatic and verbal components, the caster must be in possession of material components that vary from spell to spell and are consumed in the casting. Where no actual components are detailed in the spell description, assume the cost is negligible and that the caster has enough on their person to cover an average adventure, or about a month or so of adventuring. If a specific component is noted, however, the caster will need to purchase and keep Rastrear of the required components. A caster that is somehow separated from their material components will be unable to cast any spells until the situation can be rectified.

### Restricted Actions During Casting

While performing magic, no matter what discipline, characters are only able to:

- Move at a maximum of walking pace.
- Perform Free or Reactive Actions.

Therefore, characters cannot attack any foes while preparing a spell, or make any attempt to run or indeed perform any other skill. This reflects the deliberation needed to focus on the spell and channel the energy for it to have its desired effect.

At the Games Master's discretion, some Reactive Actions such as Parrying, or Evading may make completing a spell more difficult due to disruptions incurred to the normally required somatic gestures or mental focus.

### Casting Spells While Engaged

Spells with a Range of no more than 5 feet, including Touch spells, may be cast while Engaged with an opponent. Spells with a Range of greater than 5 feet may not be cast while Engaged.

### Casting Touch Spells

Spells that require the caster to touch their opponent do not require an additional Unarmed skill roll to do so, as reaching out to make physical contact is assumed part of the spell's somatic component and is therefore covered by their spell casting roll.

### Interrupting Casting

All magic used in combat situations has casting times measured in periods of time from Instant to 1 or more Actions. This means a spellcaster performing more complex invocations can be slowed down in their casting by reacting to threats which use up their available Action Points. However, unless the caster suffers some dramatic shock, all this does is delay the final completion of the magic.

To totally disrupt casting normally requires that the caster be injured or mentally subdued. The chance of this depends on the precise circumstances:

- Successful implementation of the Spoil Spell Special Effect will automatically cause the casting roll to Fail.
- Minor Wounds force the caster to make a For√ßa de Vontade check, Failure makes the casting 1 Difficulty Grade harder.
- Serious Wounds force the caster to make a For√ßa de Vontade check, pasCanto makes the casting 1 grade harder, while failing makes it 2 grades harder.
- Major Wounds automatically cause the casting roll to Fail.
- Succumbing to mental domination automatically causes the casting roll to Fail.

###  Casting in Armor

**Clerics:** Clerics suffer no penalty while armored or uCanto a shield.

**Mages:** Because armor restricts Movimento, and the somatic component involved in the casting of spells requires precise gestures, mages cannot cast while wearing armor or uCanto a shield.

---
## Casting Time

Spells generally require a set Casting Time regardless of Intensity. This is usually measured as _Instant_,  _Actions_, _Minutes_, or _Hours_. Other casting times are possible depending on the specific spell.

How this interacts with each specific Casting Time is further detailed below:

- **Instant:** Spell may be either Proactive or Reactive and goes off as soon as cast. It may be cast as a Free Action.
- **1 Action:** Spell is Proactive only and goes off on the same Turn that it is cast.
- **2 or more Actions:** Spell is Proactive only and goes off on the last Turn required to cast it.
- **Minutes, Hours, and so on:** Spells with extensive casting times are typically used out of combat and therefore do not require detailed Rastrearing.

Where a spell requires more than 1 Action to cast, the Action Points are spent each Turn, with the casting skill roll taking place on the final Turn of casting. Only once the spell's Casting Time has finished is the caster required to expend the Magic Point Casting Cost, shown below.

---
## Casting Cost

The cost of casting a spell, regardless of the actual discipline, depends on the spell's final Intensity, the caster's Rank, and the success level of the casting skill roll. Spells are cast at a base Intensity of 1 and may be increased to their Maximum Intensity to boost their effects by paying the extra Magic Points. The required cost may be expressed as _1_, meaning that the spell cost 1 Magic Point and typically has a set Intensity, or, _1, +1/additional Intensity_, meaning the spell cost a Cantole Magic Point, and may be boosted at an additional cost of 1 Magic Point per Intensity beyond the first, or, _3/Intensity_, meaning that each level of Intensity costs 3 Magic Points, or any other similar combination.

Some powerful spells can alter reality in some lasting way. In addition to the noted Magic Point expenditure, these spells require a permanent expenditure of life force on the part of the caster. This life force is represented in the sacrifice of 1 or more Experience Rolls and will be expressed as (+1 EXP) or similar. These Experience Rolls must be already acquired and unspent. Spells that require an Experience Roll have their Magnitude doubled for the purposes of resisting spells such as Dispel Magic.

Once the final cost is known, the Spell Casting roll is made:

- **Critical:** The spell works and only half the Magic Point cost is expended. A spell possesCanto a cost of 1 may be cast for free. Any required EXP rolls are halved as well, with a minimum of one in either case.
- **Success:** The spell works, and the full Magic Point cost and any required EXP rolls are expended.
- **Failure:** The spell fails, but no Magic Points are expended, nor are any Experience Rolls. Optionally, however, the caster may force the spell. A forced spell is treated as a Success above with regards to Magic Point expenditure and degree of success. Forcing a spell has the unfortunate side effect of expunging it from the caster's memory, meaning it must be memorized again before it may be recast.
- **Fumble:** The spell fails, and half the Magic Point cost is expended; however, all Experience Rolls are retained. In addition, the desired spell is expunged from the caster's memory. It may be re-memorized later.

### Maximum EXP on Spells

As noted under Casting Cost above, more powerful spells require an expenditure of life force, and thus spending one or more EXP rolls along with the requisite number of Magic Points. This can be unspent EXP the character has saved for spell casting or simply has yet to apply to skills and abilities. The character's Rank sets a limit on the maximum number of EXP rolls that they may expend on spells in any one game session. For example, a Rank 3 magic-user can spend up to 3 EXP rolls on spells during a particular session but once spent, other spells requiring EXP may not be cast until the next game session.

### Casting Cost Reduction and Caster Rank

As a spellcaster increases in Rank, they learn more efficient ways to channel their personal reserves of magical energy. For each Rank attained above 1, a spellcaster may cast spells of a lower Rank at a reduction of 2 Magic Points per Rank of difference. This does not reduce the Casting Cost per Intensity, just the final Casting Cost of the spell in question. Therefore, a spellcaster of Rank 3 that casts a Rank 2 spell may reduce the final Casting Cost by 2 Magic Points, while that same caster may cast a spell of Rank 1 at a 4-point reduction. This is summarized on the Magic Point Reduction Matrix below.

No spell may have its final cost reduced below 1 Magic Point.

##### Magic Point Reduction Matrix

| Rank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0 | - | - | - | - |
| 2 | -2 | 0 | - | - | - |
| 3 | -4 | -2 | 0 | - | - |
| 4 | -6 | -4 | -2 | 0 | - |
| 5 | -8 | -6 | -4 | -2 | 0 |

### DismisCanto One's Own Magic

Characters can dismiss any magic they have personally cast as a Free Action. No roll is needed for dismisCanto a spell; simply the decision needed to cease its effects.

---
## Magnitude & Intensity

These two terms are methods of describing the potency of magic. Magnitude indicates how difficult it is to dispel or resist the magic, whereas Intensity reflects its level of effect. More detail concerning these terms is described for each discipline.

Although Maximum Intensity and Magnitude are based upon the value of a magical skill, they are not modified by any Difficulty Grades applied to the casting roll. For example, the Maximum Intensity of a spell is 1/10th the caster's Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling skill, no matter whether the casting roll is Easy, Hard, or even Herculean. The spell may be cast at any Intensity of between 1 and its Maximum Intensity. The spell's Magnitude is always based on the Maximum. Therefore, a caster with 60% skill may choose to cast a 3 Intensity Fire Ball; however, the spell will still possess a Magnitude of 6. A caster need not increase the Intensity to their Maximum values if they desire to limit the spell's effect or keep its Magic Point cost low. In addition, not all spells benefit from an increase in Intensity.

_For example, with an Arcane Casting skill of 56%, Rengarth possesses a Maximum Intensity and Magnitude of 6, for any spell he chooses to cast. His spell's Intensity starts at 1 and may be increased to 6 by spending additional Magic Points. His spell's Magnitude is 6 regardless of final Intensity._

---
## Maintaining a Spell

Spells with Durations based on Intensity do not have to be initially cast beyond an Intensity of 1 unless the caster so desires. Instead, the caster may choose (at the beginning of each period covered by the Duration), whether to maintain the spell or let it end. To maintain the spell, the caster simply spends the required Magic Points, and the spell continues for another period based on the Duration.

The only stipulation is that the caster must concentrate throughout the Duration, even in the case of spells that do not normally require Concentration. Once Concentration is ceased, the spell will finish out its current Duration and then end, unless Concentration is normally required, in which the spell ends immediately. The most that a spell may be maintained is still limited to its Magnitude as determined by 1/10th casting skill.

For example, Detect Magic has a Duration noted as 2 Minutes/Intensity, this means that at 3 levels of Intensity, the spell will last 6 minutes. However, there is no reason why the caster could not cast the spell at Intensity 1 for 2 minutes and extend the Duration when the current Duration expires. In this case, the caster would have to maintain Concentration throughout the first 2 minutes and could spend another Magic Point to extend it another 2 minutes after the first Duration has expired. If after chooCanto to maintain Detect Magic for another 2 minutes, the caster chooses to cease Concentration, the spell will finish out its current Duration and then end.

---
## Resisting Magic

Most spells and magical effects that target an individual allow that individual a chance to resist; this is sometimes called rolling to save. Resisting targets may make an Opposed Toler√¢ncia, For√ßa de Vontade, or even an Evas√£o test in the case of a targeted missile spell. Note that Resist (Evas√£o) requires the target to have a Combat Action available to throw themselves clear. Spells that may be resisted are always easier to resist at lower levels of Magnitude. To resist a spell, the victim compares the results of their Resistance roll with the caster's Arcane Casting or Channel skill roll. Where the original caster's skill is unknown, which may be the case of spells with Permanent durations, magical traps, and so on, make a casting skill roll at 55% for Rank 1 spells, +20% per additional Rank of the spell. Therefore, a Rank 3 spell would be resisted as if the caster had a skill of 95%.

---
## Dispelling Magic

All magic resists being dispelled uCanto its Magnitude. Thus, at lower levels of skill, magic can be easy to dismiss. When Dispel Magic is cast against an ongoing magical effect or a magic item, there is no roll to resist. Instead, if the Intensity of Dispel Magic exceeds the Magnitude of the magic, it is dispelled, temporarily in the case of a magic item, or a spell with a Duration expressed as Permanent. See the write-up for [Dispel Magic](0010_Spells.md?id=dispel-magic) in the [Chapter 10: Spells](0010_Spells.md). In addition to Dispel Magic, some spells may be used to dispel other spells if they are the same or opposed. These spells will be noted as such in their write-ups. The spell Light, for example, may be used to dispel Darkness.

In these cases, every 1 level of Intensity counts as 3 Intensity with regards to countering the spell.

For example, if confronted with Darkness of Magnitude 6, the caster would need Dispel Magic of Intensity 7, or Light of only Intensity 3 to counter it.

It should be stressed, that under most circumstances, the Magnitude of an existing spell is unknown and dispelling it is a matter of trial and error.

---
## Enduring Magic Costs

As a rule, the Magic Points (or pool) of a spellcaster are temporarily reduced by the cost of all ongoing active magic. The caster is unable to start recovering Magic Points used to cast a spell (or similar ability) until that magic is dismissed or expires. Therefore, spells such as Charm Person, which can have a Duration measured in weeks, can severely hamper a magic-user that has decided to charm his own personal retinue. A spell with a Duration noted as Permanent does not affect the caster's Magic Point total.

---
## Spell Traits

Every Spell is defined by a series of traits explaining how it is used in the game, followed by a description of the spell's precise effects. In most cases the physical and temporal parameters of the spell can be hand waved unless the Games Master wishes to keep detailed Rastrear during tactical situations. A spell's traits are detailed uCanto the following format:

#### Spell Name \(R\)

(School)

| | |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Rank:** Cleric 1 | **Casting Time:** 1 Action |
| **Sphere:** Light | **Duration:** Instant |
| **Cost:** 1, +1/additional Intensity | **Range:** 0 |
| **Area:** 20' Radius | **Resist:** For√ßa de Vontade |

The traits are as follows:

#### Spell Name \(R\)

Some spells are Reversible; these spells will be marked with "\(R\)" after the spell's primary name. A spellcaster must choose when memorizing a spell noted as Reversible, whether it will be the normal or reversed version. It is possible to have both the normal and reversed versions of the same spell memorized.

<details>

<summary>* Community Errata</summary>

---

#### Spell Name \(R\) 
- _formerly "(Reversed Spell Name)"_

_The original text was as follows: "Some spells are Reversible; these spells will have their reversed version names in parentheses after the spell's primary name."_

_This made the spell list tables bloated and hard to read with multi-line cell text like `Cure Major Wounds (Cause Major Wounds)`. The names are abbreviated now to `<primary spell> (R)`._

---
</details>

#### (School)
Following the name of the spell, is the School it belongs to. Spells belong to one of eight specific Schools of Magic, and while they are noted for both Arcane and Divine spells, the information is of most use to casters of the Arcane persuasion. While most mages remain generalists, being able to learn any spell, some prefer to concentrate on one School at the expense of others.

For example, the School of Evocation specializes in manipulating unseen sources of power to create devastating damaging effects, granting access to spells such as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Magic Missile. On the other hand, the School of Enchantment teaches spells that affect the minds of others, allowing the caster to control or Influ√™ncia their normal behavior. This School includes spells such as Charm Person, Befuddle, and Command.

A magic-user's spell book might only contain spells of a Cantole School, or it could contain several spells of each. The precise balance or lack thereof is dependent upon the original creator of the spell book.

Spells of the School of Enchantment have (Charm) noted as a reminder that these spells are typically subject to immunity by elves and half-elves.

#### (School)

_The original text included a final sentence on schools of Arcane magic: "See the magic-user description in chapter 3 for the rules on specialist mages and more information on the various Schools of Magic."_

_The Schools of Magic are covered in the full Classic Fantasy rules but not in Classic Fantasy Imperative so the line has been removed._

</details>


#### Rank
Notes the spell's Rank as it pertains to the Classes that can cast it. A spell that is Rank 1 for one Class, may be Rank 2 or even higher for another. 

<details>

<summary>* Community Errata</summary>

#### Spell Traits / Rank

_The original text was as follows: "**Rank:** Notes the spell's Rank as it pertains to the Classes that can cast it. A spell that is Rank 1 for one Class, may be Rank 2 or even higher for another. **Classes are abbreviated as Clr (Cleric) or Mag (Magic-User). Mag 1 denotes a that it is a Rank 1 Magic-User spell for example.**"_

_The table format is clearer when spelling out the classes in full - i.e. Cleric instead of Clr, Mage instead of Mag._
_This makes the explanation redundant so it has been removed._

---

</details>

#### Sphere
Arcane spells do not have this trait. Divine spells are classified according to Sphere, of which there are 16: All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian, Cura, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather. Where more than one Sphere is noted, the character Class must have access to each. Some spells note a separate Sphere in parentheses; this details the spell's Sphere when reversed. Deities have several Spheres of Influ√™ncia which is a determining part of their nature.

#### Cost (X)
This is the cost in Magic Points to cast a spell. For example, a spell with a cost noted as "1", costs a Cantole Magic Point to cast and cannot be increased in Intensity, while "3 +1/additional Intensity" would cost 5 Magic Points to cast at 3 Intensity (3 for the first level, and 1 for each additional). Some spells which alter reality in a significant way have an additional cost in Experience Rolls, for example (+1 EXP).

#### Area (X)
The spell affects all targets within a defined area. This could be either a set amount, such as 20,' or as a variable such as 10'/Intensity. For example, a spell with an Area trait expressed as 10' Radius/Intensity, cast at Intensity 4 would have a radius of 40.' An Area spell with a Range of 0 has the effects centered upon the caster or whatever they touch.

- **Caster:** The spell affects the caster only.
- **1 or more Targets:** The spell affects one or more targets, of which one may be the caster if desired.
- **Cone (X):** The spell affects all targets within a specified Cone-shaped area. Cones possess three equal dimensions, length, width, and height with the specific dimensions defined in the description.
- **Path:** The spell affects all targets within a specified predefined Path.
- **Radius (X):** Radius measures a circular area from its center to its edge. Therefore, an area with a 20' radius is 40' across.
- **Wedge (X):** The spell affects all targets within a specified Wedge-shaped area. Wedges possess two equal dimensions; length and width, lacking any vertical dimension, with the specific dimensions defined in the description.

#### Casting Time (Instant, Turns, Actions, Minutes, or Hours)
The length of time required to cast a spell is defined as Instant, or 1 or more Actions, Rounds, Minutes, or Hours. This Casting Time is not typically modified by Intensity unless otherwise noted.

#### Duration (X)
The spell's effects stay in place for an amount of time described as either a set length, such as 10 minutes, or as a variable such as 5 Minutes/Intensity. Spells noted as Instant take place immediately and then end, while spells detailed as Permanent have a lasting effect.

- **Concentration:** The spell's active effects only function so long as the character specifically concentrates on it. Concentration requires the caster to be free of all physical and mental distractions: any such disturbance has a chance to interrupt the Concentration, resulting in the spell's immediate dismissal. Distraction follows the rules for [Interrupting Casting](0009_Magic.md?id=interrupting-casting).
- While concentrating, the caster is usually restricted to moving at a maximum of walking pace and performing Free or Reactive Actions (when necessary, use common sense). Any passive elements of the spell continue running without the need to concentrate unless the spell states otherwise; for example, the Spiritual Hammer spell requires Concentration to move and attack with it, as soon as the cleric's Concentration lapses, the spell ends. By default, a spellcaster may only concentrate on a Cantole Concentration spell at any one time.
- **Trigger:** Trigger spells have their effects delayed by a period defined in the spell's description or sometimes at a time determined by the caster. If a spell not defined as permanent until triggered is not triggered within a four-hour period, it dissipates naturally.

#### Range (X)
Ranged spells may be cast upon targets within a Range defined as either Touch, or a set amount such as 40'. For example, a spell with a ranged trait expressed as 20'/Intensity and cast at Intensity 3 would have a Range of 60'. A spell with a Range of 0 may be cast on the caster only.

With regards to Touch spells, the spellcaster may always be the beneficiary if desired. Otherwise, the caster must be in physical contact with the target for the spell to take effect. These spells are typically cast and then held until the caster can make a successful Unarmed skill roll to touch an opponent. However, if the caster is within reach of a suitable opponent on the same Turn that the casting is finished, they may touch the opponent without a separate Unarmed roll being required. This assumes the roll to hit is part of the spell's somatic component. The opponent may Parry or Evas√£o normally, and if struck, is still allowed an Opposed Roll to resist as specified in the spell description, with a success on the part of the victim negating any adverse effects. A Touch spell merely needs to contact the target or its worn accoutrements to work.

#### Resist (Disbelief/Evas√£o/Toler√¢ncia/For√ßa de Vontade)
Offensive spells do not necessarily take effect automatically. Resisting targets may make an Opposed Evas√£o, Toler√¢ncia, or For√ßa de Vontade test (as specified in the description) in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evas√£o) spells require the target to have a Combat Action available to throw themselves clear, and Disbelief must be stated by the player and is situation dependent. See the rules for [attempting to disbelieve](0009_Magic.md?id=attempting-to-disbelieve) Illusions and Phantasms later in this chapter for additional information.

### Limiting Some Spell Traits

Many spells will augment more than 1 trait per level of Intensity. For example, Part Water is noted as possesCanto the traits: Duration: 10 Minutes/Intensity and Range: 60 ft/Intensity. In these cases, under normal circumstances Duration and Range are equally affected based upon final Intensity. However, if the caster chooses, they may keep some of the traits at full Intensity and limit others. Therefore, if Part Water were to be cast at 4 Intensity, it would normally possess a Duration of 40 minutes with a Range of 240 feet. If desired, the caster could keep the 240-foot Range, but have the spell only last for 5 minutes.

There is no minimum amount imposed on a spell trait. The only exception would be a spell with a static trait unaffected by Intensity. In this instance the trait may not be altered. For example, a Fireball spell possesses a radius of 20 feet. One of the things that balances this powerful spell is that it cannot have its area modified, making it just as dangerous to allies and enemies if not used with caution.

---
## Illusions and Phantasms

Illusions and phantasms are two different types of magic that produce similar effects yet operate under a different set of parameters. Both attempt to trick the senses of those observing them into believing they are real, and the prospect of uCanto them successfully in play comes from knowing what each is capable and incapable of doing. Constructs such as golems and programmed undead such as skeletons and zombies are immune to the effects of illusions and phantasms, lacking any form of cognitive reasoning beyond simple programming. Both phantasms and illusions, while similar, operate differently as detailed below:

### Illusion

An illusion is a manifestation that is created within an area. Once it comes into being, everyone that happens upon the area will see the illusion for as long as it remains. Depending on the specific spell, illusions may manipulate light, sound, shadow, color, and/or scent. Some of the higher Rank forms of illusionary magic may create manifestations of quasi-reality by drawing magical energy from other planes of existence. These illusions are real for all intents and purposes for as long as the witnesses believe in them. Simple illusions may be of anything the illusionist desires, their only real limitation is that they cannot make something look like nothing. Therefore, while a simple illusion could not turn something invisible, it could camouflage it with a thick area of fog, or simply change its appearance. The exception to this is the Invisibility spell, which is specialized Illusion magic with the sole purpose of turning a creature invisible at the expense of versatility.

Illusions possess an Area of Effect when cast. This does not imply that the illusion can only be seen within the designated area, only that the manifestation must fit within the Area of Effect. The manifestation can typically be seen at a distance appropriate to its nature.

For example, the illusion of a swampy bog may not be seen until the viewers are right upon it, while an illusion of a wizard's tower may be seen from a mile away. While the illusion is in effect, it may be viewed by all that experience it, not just those present when the spell was cast.

Unless specified otherwise, an illusion is dispelled by simply touching it, whether with a bare hand, melee weapon, or even striking it with a hurled object. However, if the original caster is present and maintaining Concentration, they may prevent the illusion from unraveling and have it react appropriately. This requires the expenditure of 1 Magic Point on the part of the caster. It is subject to disbelief as normal, as well as Dispel Magic, if it overcomes the spell's Magnitude, both of which will dispel the manifestation.

For example, instead of letting an illusion struck in combat be dispelled, the illusionist could spend a Magic Point and have the illusionary creature react to the hit in an appropriate manner.

### Phantasm

A Phantasm is a manifestation that is created within the mind of one or more living creatures; because of this they may never manifest as quasi-reality. Most phantasms attempt to instill intense emotion on the part of the victim, typically those of fear and terror. Because of their nature, phantasms function differently than other spells (illusions included), with regards to Duration and Area of Effect.

For example, a phantasm with a 60' radius and a Duration of 10 minutes that has been cast on a party of adventurers will cause the party to be affected by the manifestation throughout the spell's Duration. Even if they leave the Area of Effect, they will see the manifestation within the designated area upon looking back. However, if a second group enters the spells Area of Effect while the Duration is still active, they will see nothing out of the ordinary, as they were not the targets of the spell.

Unlike an illusion, phantasms cannot be touched, and therefore, cannot be dispelled in this manner. They are subject to disbelief as normal, but since they are rooted deep in the psyche of the victim, it is much harder to do so. Assume it is two grades more difficult. The casting of Dispel Magic will remove the phantasm from the mind of a victim if it overcomes the spell's Magnitude as normal. However, due to the nature of a phantasm, the caster must target a Cantole character suffering its effects and cast it on them.

### Limitations

There is no limit placed upon what the caster may create if it fits within the spell's parameters; however, the players are more likely to attempt to Disbelieve if they feel an illusion is out-of-place or simply not realistic under the circumstances. Likewise, an NPC will have that same opportunity to Disbelieve something that seems unrealistic as determined by the Games Master. A more successful illusion is typically of something the caster knows well. While it would be possible to create an illusion of something that the caster has only seen in a painting or heard about, it cannot and will not look as realistic as something they have personal knowledge of. For this reason, the simpler illusion the more believable, as it tends to give off fewer clues to its true nature.

Neither illusions nor phantasms allow the caster to break physical laws. A character would not be able to physically mount an illusionary horse; even assuming the caster maintains the illusion and prevents it from unraveling when one attempts to do so. And an illusionary bridge will not allow a party of adventurers to cross a real chasm no matter how well those affected believe in its existence. Where possible, however, those subjected to the illusion will believe things are transpiring as expected. For example, the Montariar attempting to mount the illusionary horse will see himself sitting atop it, reigns in hand, as will all others under the spell's effects, and the party of adventurers crosCanto the illusionary bridge will see themselves doing so‚Ä¶, until they impact with the bottom of the chasm.

While being concentrated upon, illusions may be made to attack and/or cause injury as appropriate to their nature with the caster determining the actual results of hits, damage, and so forth. This requires the caster to continually concentrate throughout the spell's Duration. Of course, this damage is only in the minds of the victims and no actual damage is done; however, they will believe it for real if the illusion exists, or until they Disbelieve. The illusionist may choose to have armor and magic block this damage as appropriate and dictate the results of Specials as desired. Any damage sustained from an illusionary attack or threat is treated as "real" damage as far as wound levels are concerned; however, as soon as an illusion is revealed for what it truly is, any damage previously incurred by the victim vanishes. As noted above, the caster needs to keep these results realistic and in proportion to the threat in question.

For example, an illusion of a band of attacking kobolds that cause a party of low Rank adventurers some difficulty before being put down would be an expected and common encounter; however, if these same kobolds display skills of master level, never misCanto and apparently sidestepping every blow, the players should more than likely display suspicion and would be well within their rights to attempt to Disbelieve.

A character that is "killed" by an illusion collapses as if dead. The Games Master should make a For√ßa de Vontade roll for the victim, the effects of which are as follows:

- **Fumble:** The character dies from system shock due to illusionary trauma
- **Failure:** The character awakens unharmed after 1d6 minutes
- **Success:** The character awakens unharmed in 1d6 Rounds
- **Critical:** The character resists loCanto consciousness and may immediately attempt to Disbelieve

Illusions are automatically dispelled if touched unless the caster concentrates and maintains it. It is subject to disbelief as normal as well as Dispel Magic, which will dispel the manifestation. In the case of a larger manifestation, Dispel Magic will dispel a portion of the illusion's Area of Effect equal to its own.

### Attempting to Disbelieve

To attempt to Disbelieve a common illusion, the viewers must state their intent and succeed at an Opposed Roll of their For√ßa de Vontade versus the Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling roll of the original spellcaster, as appropriate. With regards to disbelieving phantasms, which are essentially mental attacks, a character is allowed a chance to Disbelieve as soon as they are subjected to the spell; however, the Games Master should secretly make this roll on their behalf to not hint at the phantasm's true nature. Because Phantasms affect the mind directly, they are typically 2 grades more difficult to Disbelieve. In either case, a Success indicates that the viewer sees the illusion or phantasm for what it is. A Failed roll has no effect on the state of the apparition and no further attempts may be made unless stated otherwise (see below). Only sapient creatures (those with an INT Characteristic) may attempt to Disbelieve. Phantasms and illusions may also be destroyed with the casting of Dispel Magic.

The more unbelievable the illusion, the easier it is to Disbelieve, and vice versa. After the first attempt to Disbelieve, further attempts are only possible if the manifestation suddenly does something that causes a victim to question its reality. This should be on a case-by-case basis and only allowed with the Games Master's permission.

In the likely situation where some viewers see the manifestation for what it is, and others believe what they see, the players should play out the encounter as their characters believe it. _For example, those that know the ogre before them is an illusion or phantasm will attempt to reveal the true nature of the manifestation to their unbelieving allies. However, those under the spell's Influ√™ncia will be convinced that their friends are the ones being manipulated, and the ogre charging them is real._

## Scrolls

Scrolls are used by many of the _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ spellcasting Classes. They are a convenient way for casters to have access to additional spells, over and above those they can normally have memorized. Mage scrolls, other than those created by the caster, require the casting of Read Magic before they may be used. Thieves with the Ability to Use Arcane Scrolls may do so without having previously cast Read Magic upon them. Cleric scrolls do not need to have Read Magic cast and may be read by anyone to identify their contents, even a non-spellcaster. They still require a cleric to cast them, however. Protection scrolls may be read and used by anyone regardless of Class.

### Reading a Scroll

Scrolls are useful tools allowing the caster additional spell storage beyond that which can normally be memorized and are categorized by type as follows:

- **Cursed Scrolls:** Cursed scrolls may be either Arcane or Divine and bestow a negative effect upon the reader. These scrolls are activated merely by reading the name or title, or in the case of an Arcane scroll, casting Read Magic upon them. The curse takes effect immediately.
- **Protection Scrolls:** Scrolls of protection may be read even by non-spellcasters and require a Cantole Cast Magic Action on the part of the reader to take effect. The contents of the scroll depend on the nature of its creator, with different practitioners having access to forms of protection, as follows:
  - **Cleric Protection Scrolls:** Demons, Devils, Possession, Undead.
  - **Magic-User Protection Scrolls:** Demons, Elementals, Lycanthropes, Magic, Petrification.
- **Spell Scrolls:** Each spell scroll may contain a Cantole magic-user or cleric spell, regardless of Rank, and each follows the same procedure as casting it normally with regards to Casting Time. However, casting a spell from a scroll requires no expenditure of Magic Points; this price was paid in advance by the scroll's original creator.

A caster may automatically cast any spell from a scroll, assuming they are of the appropriate Class and that they themselves are of sufficient Rank to cast that spell. If they know the spell in question, it requires no skill roll. This causes the spell to disappear from the scroll as the magic is consumed in the spell's casting. A spellcaster may also attempt to cast a spell of a higher Rank, but this requires a successful roll of either Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling as appropriate. A Failure means that the spell is not cast and has been erased from the scroll. On a Fumble, the spell has been miscast. This typically results in the spell affecting the reader and/or one or more allies or having the opposite effect of what was desired.

The difficulty applied to the skill roll is dependent upon the difference between the caster's Rank and the spell's Rank and is detailed in the following table:

#### Scroll Casting Difficulty

| Difference | Modifier |
| :-- | :-- |
| Spell is of the caster's Rank or lower | Spell may be cast with no skill roll |
| Spell is 1 Rank higher than the caster | Spell may be cast with a successful skill roll |
| Spell is 2 Rank higher than the caster | Spell may be cast with a successful Hard skill roll |
| Spell is 3 Rank higher than the caster | Spell may be cast with a successful Formidable skill roll |
| Spell is 4 Rank higher than the caster | Spell may be cast with a successful Herculean skill roll |

### Defending Against a Scroll's Effects

Any harmful magical effects of a scroll may be resisted uCanto the normal methods appropriate to the effects in question. Those resisting may make an Opposed Toler√¢ncia, For√ßa de Vontade, or Evas√£o roll, vs. the scroll's Magnitude x10. A scroll possesses a Magnitude equal to its Intensity. Note that Resist (Evas√£o) requires the target to have a Combat Action available in order to throw themselves clear.
