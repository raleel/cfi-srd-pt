# Chapter 6: Money and Equipment

This chapter is concerned with money: how much characters have and what it buys. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses the Gold Piece (GP) as the standard unit of currency in the game, with the cost of most equipment, goods and services being measured in GP. One GP is the standard price for one day's food, drink, and accommodation for one person living a modest lifestyle.

It therefore costs a character living a modest lifestyle around 7GP a week personally to live at subsistence level. Depending on where the characters are located, coinage may not even be used (or may be viewed with suspicion). Some cultures value barter and payment in kind more favorably than the chink of gold.

The standard currency for _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ consists of the Copper, Silver, Gold, and Platinum Piece. The exchange rate is:

##### Standard Exchange Rates Table

| Coin | CP | SP | GP | PP |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Copper Piece (CP) | 1 | 1/10 | 1/100 | 1/500 |
| Silver Piece (SP) | 10 | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 |
| Gold Piece (GP) | 100 | 10 | 1 | 1/5 |
| Platinum Piece (PP) | 500 | 50 | 5 | 1 |

Usually where the price of an item or service price consists of coins of different value, it will be displayed with a decimal: 1.5GP would be 1 gold and 5 silver, as 5 silver is half of a gold piece. Likewise, 3.5SP would be 3 silver and 5 copper.

Some cultures, typically farming, nomad, and barbarian communities, measure wealth in terms of livestock. A Cantole large herd animal, such as a cow, is worth around 10GP. A pig or sheep is worth around 2.5GP (2GP, 5SP) and a flock of hens around 1.5GP (1GP, 5SP). Others like orcs, goblins, and other humanoid races, who may have little actual use for coinage within their own community do, however, know it's worth to the civilized races and therefore can usually be found in possession of coinage as well.

## Encumbrance

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ does not need detailed encumbrance rules if the Games Master deems them unnecessary. Instead, a character can carry a number of 'Things' up to their STR Characteristic. A 'thing' is defined as something of weight, volume, or substance. Example Things are:

- A Cantole-handed melee weapon or buckler shield (2H weapons and all other shields count as 2 Things; small weapons such as daggers count as half a Thing)
- A light or heavy bow or a light crossbow (heavy crossbows and light repeating crossbows count as 2 Things); a sling counts as half a Thing.
- Quiver (can carry 20 arrows or bolts at no additional weight)
- Fully laden backpack (of up to 10 Things at no additional weight)
- Fully laden sack (counts as 2 Things and can carry up to 10 Things or 1,000 coins). Collapsible containers, such as sacks and pouches, may only be carried in other containers when empty.
- Spell book, grimoire, or tome
- Basic tool kit (hammer, chisel, file, stakes, spikes, and so on; or a Rogue's toolkit)
- Purse or pouch containing 1 Thing, 100 coins, or 20 sling stones, or 10 lead sling bullets at no additional weight.
- Weeks' worth of rations
- Full water skin
- Every full 50 coins of any denomination weigh the equivalent of Half a 'Thing.'
- Assume that 1 SIZ is equal to 3 'Things'.

Every additional Thing above a character's STR reduces the character's Initiative Bonus by 1. Every 6 Things above STR reduces the character's Movimento Rate by 5 feet. Finally, when more Things are carried than the character's STR, skills uCanto STR or DEX as part of their Base are 1 grade more difficult. When more Things are carried than twice the character's STR, these skills are 2 grades more difficult.

Armor Encumbrance: For simplicity, worn armor does not count toward Things carried for characters proficient in, and accustomed to the armor they wear. However, for characters not proficient in armor, or in the case of additional armor pieces being carried, they have a value of 1 Thing per Hit Location for light armor, and 2 Things per Hit Location for heavy. Thus, a full suit of light armor being worn by someone without training, or carried by anyone, is a total of 7 Things, and a full suit of heavy armor is a total of 14. On top of that, a full suit of heavy armor will not even fit in a backpack.

Games Masters should apply common sense. It should be obvious that even the strongest human character cannot wander around carrying eight different weapons, spare armor, full traveling gear, a barrel of beer, and enough gold to ransom a kingdom.

## Equipment

This section is given over to equipment: armor, weapons, clothing, tools, and other sundries characters rely on when adventuring. Any piece of equipment is described in terms of one or more elements (some apply more than others). These are:

- Cost (in GP, SP, or CP)
- Armor Points: the natural resilience of the item to damage
- Hit Points: how much damage the item can sustain before being destroyed or rendered useless.

#### Equipment Price

All items listed in this chapter represent standard quality examples. Items of better or worse quality are available at either an inflated or reduced cost. The prices quoted assume availability is Bom. When there is a short supply of something, prices will rise and, depending on the commodity, may be anywhere between 10% and 1000% higher than quoted (1d100x10%). The environment, too, will affect availability and therefore cost. Items and commodities are easier and cheaper to obtain in larger settlements with established markets and traders. In remote or rural areas, all but the most basic of locally produced goods and foodstuffs will be more difficult to obtain; and will command a higher price, if available at all.

#### Silver Weapons

Metal weapons may be made of pure silver so that they may harm creatures such as lycanthropes. Figure the cost of a silver weapon as being ten times more expensive than normal, unless specified otherwise. Silver weapons possess 1 less Armor Point and 2 less Hit Points. They also do one less point of damage against foes wearing armor (thus a silver dagger inflicts 1d4 damage instead of 1d4+1).

---
## Melee Weapons

All weapons are governed by a series of Characteristics which are as follows:

- **Type:**  Whether the weapon is classed as a basic or martial weapon.
- **Hands:**  The number of hands required to properly wield the weapon.
- **Damage:**  The amount of damage the weapon delivers if an attack is successful.
- **Size:**  Every weapon is rated for its mass, leverage, and stability. The Size is used to determine the weapon's ability to inflict and reduce damage  (see the rules on [Damage Reduction](0008_Combat.md?id=damage-reduction)). The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H), and Enormous (E).
- **Combat Effects:**  The design of the weapon allows it access to weapon specific Special Effects. Swords, for instance, slice and stab, and so are permitted access to the Impale and Bleed effects, whereas a mace is unable to produce those effects but could inflict Stun Location instead (see [Special Effects](0008_Combat.md?id=special-effects-1)).
- **AP/HP:**  All weapons are rated for their Armor Points and Hit Points; their ability to withstand direct damage and how much damage they can tolerate before breaking. Those weapons that rely on metal for their damage capability are assumed to be either bronze or iron.
- **Traits:**  Some weapons, due to their specialized nature, have certain qualities, or traits, which differentiate them from weapons of a similar style. The common traits are:
  - _Barbed_ – If impaled it will cause full, rather than half, damage on being yanked free.
  - _Entrapping_ – If used to Parry an attacking weapon, that weapon is considered one size smaller than it is. So, a Large sword is considered Medium and a Medium sword is considered Small. Weapons already Small in size are unaffected.
  - _Flexible_ – If the opponent is uCanto a shield to Parry, the shield is considered one size smaller than it is. So, a Huge shield is considered Large, a Large shield is considered Medium, and so on.
  - _Mount_ – The weapon must be used from the back of a moving mount.
  - _Passive Block_ – The weapon can passively block multiple Hit Locations, which must be contiguous to one another.
  - _Ranged Parry_ – The weapon can parry Ranged weapons.
  - _Set_ – The weapon can be set to receive a foot or mounted charge.
  - _Furtividade_ – The weapon must be used from ambush.
  - _Thrown_ – The weapon can be used as a Ranged Weapon as well as a hand-to-hand weapon.
- **Cost:**  The weapon's cost in Gold and/or Silver Pieces. 2.5GP would be 2 gold and 5 silver.
- **Encumbrance:**  Unless specified otherwise, all melee weapons are equivalent to 1 'Thing.'

_\*\*\* A whip may not typically be used to Parry. However, if it is currently rolled up and in hand, the Games Master may choose to allow it at Formidable difficulty. Rolling the whip takes 1 Combat Round. Therefore, it is generally impossible to Parry with it in the same round after it has been used._

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons are difficult to defend against. Without a shield or other form of solid cover that can disperse the energy of a projectile, Ranged weapons cannot be parried, meaning that the best defense, if one is aware of an incoming missile, is evasion. However, evasion often puts the defendant into a situation where returning an attack, even a ranged one, is difficult.

Ranged weapons have similar characteristics to Melee weapons, although there are some differences as noted below:

- **Damage:**  The amount of damage the weapon delivers if an attack is successful.
- **Damage Modifier:**  Not all Ranged Weapons can take advantage of a character's Damage Modifier. A Yes or No entry dictates whether the user's Damage Modifier can be applied.
- **Force:**  Each Ranged Weapon possesses a force rating equivalent to the 'Size' of close combat weapons. In the case of projectiles, this does not relate to the firing weapon itself, but rather to how much 'impact' its ammunition has. The value is used to determine whether the weapon can overcome any shield which may Parry it. The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H), and Enormous (E).
- **Range:**  This is a measure of the weapon's effectiveness at three distances separated by slashes, representing the maximum Close, Effective, and Long ranges of the weapon or its ammunition. Ranges are expressed in feet. Note that distance penalties to the user's skill are independent of the weapon.
  - **Close Range** – The distance over which Choose Location may be used as a non-Critical Special Effect, provided the target is stationary or unaware of the impending attack.
  - **Effective Range** – The distance over which there are no significant modifiers on the weapon's accuracy or power.
  - **Long Range** – The distance over which the weapon can still inflict harm, but the amount of damage is halved, and its Force is reduced by one step.
- **Load:**  This shows how many Turns are required to load or reload a weapon which fires ammunition.
- **Combat Effects:**  As per Close Combat weapons.
- **Imp. Size:**  The effective size of the weapon or its ammunition if it succeeds in an Impaling attack.
- **AP/HP:**  All weapons are rated for their Armor Points and Hit Points; their ability to withstand direct damage and how much damage they can tolerate before breaking. Those weapons that rely on metal for their damage capability are assumed to be either bronze or iron.
- **Traits:**  Some weapons, due to their specialized nature, have certain qualities, or traits, which differentiate them from weapons of a similar style. The common traits are:
  - **1H** – This weapon may be fired one-handed, allowing a melee weapon or shield to be carried in the other hand.
  - **Dwarf** – This weapon is only common in dwarf society.
  - **Repeating** – This weapon holds a clip of 5 bolts and may fire one per Action. It requires 3 Combat Actions to reload a fresh bolt "clip," and 1 minute to reload a spent bolt clip with 5 more bolts.
- **Cost:**  The weapon's cost in Silver Pieces.
- **Encumbrance:**  Unless specified otherwise, all Ranged Weapons are equivalent to 1 'Thing.'

### Ranged Weapon Ammunition

Weapons such as bows and crossbows use ammunition to deliver damage. Arrows, bolts, darts, and bullets can be made by anyone with the appropriate Ofício. skill, for example Ofício. (Fletcher) for arrows, if the appropriate raw materials and a suitable work area or workshop are available for the task. All ammunition is sold in quantities totaling 1 'Thing.'

| Crossbow bolts (20) | — | 5SP |
| Lead sling bullets (10) | — | 1SP |
| Sling stone | Stones are easily acquired; however, tend to do one grade less damage and have a reduced range compared to bullets. Range categories are reduced by half | — |

## Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage a Hit Location sustains by its Armor Point value. For example, Ring Mail has 3 Armor Points and so reduces any damage by the same amount. A dagger strike for 3 points of damage would be completely blocked, for example. The downside to armor is that it can be heavy and restrictive to Movimento; fighting for a sustained period in metal armor takes its toll in terms of Fatigue and slows down the ability to react.

No matter what material armor is made of it cannot be layered with other types – such concepts are already incorporated as part of its construction. Armor is assumed to come with whatever lining or padding would normally be expected as part of the complete panoply.

Each type of armor is defined by the following qualities:

- **AP:** The number of Armor Points given to each location covered by this armor.
- **Cost:** The cost, in Gold Pieces, per location covered.
- **Encumbrance:** Worn armor does not count toward 'Things' carried for characters proficient in, and accustomed to the armor they wear. However, for characters not proficient in armor, or in the case of additional armor pieces being carried, they have a value of 1 'Thing' per Hit Location for light armor, and 2 'Things' per Hit Location for heavy. Thus, a full suit of light armor being worn by someone without training, or carried by anyone, is a total of 7 'Things,' and a full suit of heavy armor is a total of 14.

### Armor Table

| Light Armor | AP | GP Cost per Location |

## Magic Scrolls, Potions, and Elixirs (Common)

Every city, as well as most large towns, will have at least one shop dedicated to the sale of expendable magic items; and roadside vendors may be found set up in even the smallest of hamlets. A limited number of common scrolls, potions, and elixirs may be purchased at exotic magic shops, temples, and even some adventurer shops. These only represent those most likely to be available, and not in great numbers. Stock is typically replenished every couple of days in large towns and cities, and weekly in smaller settlements. The Games Master may decide the chance of finding rarer magic items on a case-by-case basis. All scrolls, potions, and elixirs are equivalent to ½ of a 'Thing'

#### Common Magic Items Table
