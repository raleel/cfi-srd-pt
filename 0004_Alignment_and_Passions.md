# Chapter 4: Alignment & Passions

UCanto Alignment and Passions in _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ can greatly assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what Conduçãos him, and so on. While the player's specific choice of Alignment and Passions found in this chapter are up to them, some found in the previous chapter pertaining to character [Classes](0003_Classes.md) are required to play that character. None of the Classes in this document require a specific Alignment or Passions, but some like the cleric and rogue (that joins a thieves' guild), require an Oath to their order or guild. An Oath can be treated like a Passion with regards to its game mechanics.

## Alignment

All characters must have an Alignment which consists of two parts: an Ethical Code and a Moral Code. The Ethical Code defines the stance toward law and chaos, while the Moral Code determines feeling toward good and evil. Characters then choose one or two defining elements for each and determine Starting Percentages. For example, Chaotic (Disorganized and Greedy) 55%, and Good (Helpful and Charitable) 55%. You may not choose Neutral twice; instead, you disregard both a Moral and Ethical Code and choose True Neutral as your Cantole Alignment. The Ethical and Moral Codes, along with their defining elements, are detailed below.

#### Ethical Code

Choose one of Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic at a Base Level of INT+POW+30.

- **Lawful** : Choose one or two defining elements that best describes your Ethical Code: _Adherence to tradition; Calculating; Closed-Minded; Hates Chaos; Ethical; Honest; Honorable; Judgmental; Lack of adaptability; No sense of humor; Obedience to legitimate authority; Organized; Predictable; Reliable; Trusting; Trustworthy; Well-mannered._

- **Neutral** : Choose one defining element that best describes your Moral Code: _Believes Good and Evil are prejudices and dangerous extremes; Cautious; Does not strongly feel one way or the other when it comes to Good and Evil; Flexible; Freedom of Action; Lacks the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others; Committed to others by personal relationships, not a Moral Code; Has no established Moral Code; Pragmatic; Seldom seek out company._

## Passions

Passions are used to assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what Conduçãos him, and so on.

A Passion can be for anything – a person, an organization, an ideal, even an object. Passions are typically described by a verb such as: Desire, Despise, Destroy, Espouse, Fear, Flee, Forswear, Hate, Love, Loyalty to, Protect, Repudiate, Respect, Seek, Subvert, Torment, or Uphold.

Passions are measured in the same way as skills; they are rated between 1 and 100 (or higher). A Passion can be improved in the same way as a skill, or it can be increased or decreased by the Games Master depending on circumstances.

Beginning characters may start with up to three Passions, each based on two Characteristics, with a bonus of +40 to the first, +30 to the second and +20 to the third, the player deciding the order of importance. These can be tied to the culture, Class, or personal foibles. For example, Distrust (Rogues); Loyal to Queen; Love Family; Defeat Chaos. Passions play a particularly important role in many character Classes as detailed in the next chapter. For some of these Classes, maintaining a Passion at a minimum level is required for the retention of Class-specific special Abilities, and in extreme situations, loCanto a Passion can result in loss of the Class.

The starting value of the Passion varies according to its type; see the [Passion Table](0004_Alignment_and_Passions.md?id=passion-table), below.

This section only details what Passions represent and their default values. How Passions are used in the game is discussed below.

##### Passion Table

| Object of Passion | Starting Percentage |
| :-- | :-- |
| A person, in a romantic or familial context | POW+CHA |
| An organization or group of people | POW+INT |
| A race or species | Character's POW x2 |
| A place | Character's POW+INT |
| An object or substance | Character's POW x2 |
| A personality trait | Character's POW+CHA |

## UCanto Alignment and Passions

An Alignment or Passion is any deeply held commitment that has the capacity to Influência events during play. Although they can be used as stand-alone Abilities (to call them skills is to do them a disservice), Passions are further expanded below to explain in more detail how they work and how they can Influência _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ characters and campaigns.

In summary, Alignment and Passions can be used thus:

- To augment another skill, reflecting the depth of one's feelings and how it Conduçãos action. When used in this regard, the Alignment or Passion adds 20% of its value to a skill being used, if the augmentation is thematically and dramatically important.
- As an Ability to Condução choices, desires and emotional actions and responses. When used in this way a Standard roll is made against an Alignment or Passion to determine how strongly the character thinks and feels about something. If a roll is a Success, then the character acts in line with what the Alignment or Passion would dictate. If the roll Fails, then the character can act freely without feeling constrained by the Passion's Conduçãos.
- To oppose other Alignments or Passions – even those held by the same character. This is typically used where an Alignment would conflict with a Passion, or even when two Passions would conflict. For instance, a personal love might dictate a course of action that would be contrary to an Oath or loyalty. Here use an Opposed Roll between the Alignment and Passion, or the two Passions, with the more successful determining how the character acts.
- As a general measure of depth of commitment, belief, and loyalty to a cause. The higher the Alignment or Passion's value, the more committed the character is. Characters with similar Alignments or Passions can compare their ratings to determine who exhibits the deeper commitment.
- To resist some form of psychological manipulation or magical domination. In certain cases where a character is being forced into performing an act contrary to their Alignment or Passions, they may substitute either for Força de Vontade in the Opposed Roll.

A character's Alignment score may drop during play if the character continually disregards their chosen morality and/or ethics. If it drops lower than the character's Base Level, it will change to an oppoCanto Alignment, Good to Neutral or Evil for example. The Games Master should determine the new Alignment and Level, depending on the circumstances. A change of Alignment may result in loCanto access to Class Abilities. See the relevant Class write-up for details.

New Passions can be developed at any point during a _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ game session if the circumstances warrant it. One might instantly develop 'Hate X' where someone else does something that would strongly invoke hatred to arise. A lord or chief calling for an Oath would immediately establish a Passion of 'Loyalty to X' as soon as that Oath is taken or sworn – something expSaberd further in the Alignment/Oaths section of each of the [Classes](0003_Classes.md).

New Passions developed during play in this way cost no Experience Rolls and are established there and then. Of course, characters can also choose to establish a Passion during improvement, at the cost of an Experience Roll to gain a Passion at its Base Value: see the various Alignments and Passions sections in the [Culture and Races](0002_Culture_and_Races.md) chapter.

## Deepening and Waning

Alignment, Passions, and Oaths can increase during a game independently of Experience Rolls, based on the strength of whatever occurred to trigger the increase. Also, they can, and do, wane. A strongly held belief can be shaken by many things, leading to that Passion being either reduced or, in more extreme circumstances, reversed completely.

For instance, a character with 'Trust Chieftain' might, if his chieftain acts treacherously, either reduce his Passion or turn it into 'Distrust Chieftain' at the same percentage. The Games Master needs to determine whether a Passion reduces or reverses. If it reduces, then it does so according to the strength of the source of the change.

The Deepening and Waning table shows how much the Passion changes.

##### Deepening and Waning Table

| Depth of Passion | Passion Modified by |
| :-- | :-- |
| Weak | 1d10 |
| Moderate | 1d10+5 |
| Strong | 1d10+10 |
